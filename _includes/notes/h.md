## The History of England (1754-62, 1778)

_prepared by Amyas Merivale_

The text of Hume's *History of England* provided on this site is based on the HTML version of the *Liberty Classics* edition, available at [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/hume-the-history-of-england-6-vols](http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/hume-the-history-of-england-6-vols). That edition is based on the posthumous 1778 edition, but is divided into 6 volumes rather than 8. This decision is a very sensible one, and has been followed here (see the general [editorial notes on volume breaks](/notes/copytexts#3-volume-breaks).

The *Liberty Classics* text was imported automatically, and is now being checked by hand. From what I can tell, it is very accurate, though there are some systematic stylistic departures from the original that I am undoing here, as well as at least a couple of small errors that I have spotted so far. I am enormously grateful to the [Liberty Fund](https://www.libertyfund.org/) for making this edition publicly available. Without this basis to work from, it is extremely unlikely I would have been able to incorporate Hume's *History* into this site any time soon.
