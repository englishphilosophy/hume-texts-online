## Essays, Moral, and Political, and Literary (1741, 1777)

_edited by Amyas Merivale_

Disappointed with the poor reception of his *Treatise*, Hume turned to the essay style of writing, and published the first volume of his *Essays, Moral and Political* in 1741, with a second volume following in 1742. Following the success of this collection, Hume published three additional essays in 1748 (*Of National Characters*, *Of the Original Contract*, and *Of Passive Obedience*), and then a third edition of the set, also in 1748, that incorporated these three.

At the start of the 1750s, Hume's reputation as an essay writer was well-established, and his new set of *Political Discourses*, published in 1752, was so successful that a second edition was brought out in the very same year. A third edition was printed in 1754.

In 1758, Hume collected all of his late works together in a collection of *Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects*, the first volume of which contained the *Essays, Moral and Political* followed by the *Political Discourses*. Now, however, the two sets were titled *Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary* parts 1 and 2.

The texts of all of the essays on this site are taken from the 1777 edition of the *Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects*, with the following exceptions: *Of Essay-Writing*, *Of Moral Prejudices*, and *Of the Middle Station of Life* only ever appeared in the 1742 edition of the *Essays, Moral and Political*, and the texts of these are therefore taken from that edition. *Of Impudence and Modesty*, *Of Love and Marriage*, and *Of the Study of History* last appeared in the 1760 edition of the *Essays and Treatises*, and the texts of these are therefore taken from that edition. *Of Avarice* and *A Character of Sir Robert Walpole* last appeared in the 1768 edition of the *Essays and Treatises*, and the texts of these are therefore taken from that edition. *A Character of Sir Robert Walpole* first appeared as an essay by itself, but in editions of Hume's essays from 1748 to 1768, it appeared as a footnote at the end of the essay *That Politics may be Reduced to a Science*; from 1770 onwards this note was dropped. The text here is a reproduction of the footnote in the 1768 edition of *That Politics may be Reduced to a Science* (though the text of _that_ essay, note, is taken from the 1777 edition, and therefore does not contain the footnote).
