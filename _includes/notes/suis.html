<h2>Of Suicide and Of the Immortality of the Soul</h2>
<p><em>Of Suicide edited by Amyas Merivale</em></p>
<p><em>Of the Immortality of the Soul edited by Peter Millican</em></p>
<p>The two essays <i>Of Suicide</i> and <i>Of the Immortality of the Soul</i> were originally planned for publication in a projected 1755 collection called <i>Five Dissertations</i>, but Hume decided to withdraw them prior to publication. They were replaced with <i>Of the Standard of Taste</i>, and the collection appeared in 1757 under the name <i>Four Dissertations</i>. The suppressed essays were eventually published posthumously and anonymously in 1777, but the text here — like the standard edition of Miller (1987) — follows instead the 1755 version, of which a proof-copy exists in the National Library of Scotland with some corrections in Hume’s handwriting. The only departures from that copy, aside from those common to all the texts on this site, are precisely these handwritten alterations, all of which are marked in the text.</p>
