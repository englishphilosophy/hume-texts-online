<h2>Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects (1758, 1777)</h2>
<p><em>edited by Amyas Merivale and Peter Millican</em></p>
<p>Hume first published a set of <i>Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects</i> in 1753. It was a four-volume set containing (in this order) the <i>Essays, Moral and Political</i>, the first <i>Enquiry</i>, the second <i>Enquiry</i>, and the <i>Political Discourses</i>. In 1754 he published another edition of volume 4 (the <i>Political Discourses</i>), and in 1756 another edition of volume 2 (the first <i>Enquiry</i>). It is the next edition, in 1758, that is particularly interesting, however, since it is here that Hume renames and reorders his philosophical writings for the last time. A large single-volume set, this collection contained the <i>Essays, Moral and Political</i> and the <i>Political Discourses</i>, now renamed <i>Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary</i> parts 1 and 2, the first <i>Enquiry</i> (now called an enquiry, rather than philosophical essays), the <i>Dissertation on the Passions</i>, the second <i>Enquiry</i>, and the <i>Natural History of Religion</i>. Though subsequent editions of these <i>Essays and Treatises</i> were sometimes in two volumes, sometimes in four, the structure from this point onwards remained the same â€” right up to the posthumous 1777 edition, which Hume was working on until his death in 1776.</p>
