<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This site contains a complete set of everything that Hume published, including the handful of posthumous publications (but excluding the historical writings), in accurate editions that faithfully represent the original 18th century publications, but without neglecting the advantages of modern on-line texts. Hume scholars will find, we hope, everything that they would expect from a modern edition, such as standard footnote and paragraph numbers, page numbers for the most frequently cited editions, and some minimal editing in cases of clear error, or for changes sanctioned by Hume himself (in ERRATA sheets or modifications in his own hand on some original copies).</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.nls.uk/">National Library of Scotland</a> and the <a href="http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/">Royal Society of Edinburgh</a>, we are also able to reproduce here high-quality digital images of Hume’s manuscript of the <i>Dialogues concerning Natural Religion</i>. These pages are made available alongside the text of the first posthumous 1779 edition.</p>
<h2>Abbreviations for the Texts</h2>
<p>It is standard practice to refer to Hume’s texts using abbreviations, though not everyone uses the same abbreviations. Commonly the <i>Treatise of Human Nature</i>, <i>Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</i>, and <i>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</i>, for example, are referred to using just the letters “T”, “E”, and “D” respectively, while other authors prefer “THN”, “EHU”, and “DNR”. But on a website such as this, long abbreviations can be cumbersome and awkward to place neatly, especially when they need to include section and paragraph details (e.g “THN 1.3.14.24”). For this reason, we have adopted the convention of using single letter abbreviations for all of Hume’s major works (including the <i>Abstract</i> and the <i>Letter from a Gentleman</i>), and longer abbreviations for his essays (including <i>My Own Life</i>). These are as follows:</p>

<h2>Copytexts</h2>
<p>The copytexts for the <i>Treatise of Human Nature</i> and the <i>Abstract</i> of the <i>Treatise</i> are the only editions that Hume published (1739 for volumes 1 and 2 of the <i>Treatise</i>, 1740 for volume 3 and the <i>Abstract</i>).</p>
<p>The copytext for the two <i>Enquiries</i>, the <i>Natural History of Religion</i>, the <i>Dissertation on the Passions</i>, and all of the essays that appeared in this edition, is the posthumous 1777 edition of the <i>Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects</i>.</p>
<p>The copytexts for <i>My Own Life</i> and the <i>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</i> are the (first) posthumous publications of 1777 and 1779 respectively.</p>
<p>The copytext for the two essays <i>Of Suicide</i> and <i>Of the Immortality of the Soul</i> is the proof copy of the <i>Four Dissertations</i> held in the National Library of Scotland (this collection was to include these scandalous essays, before Hume suppressed them and supplied the essay <i>Of the Standard of Taste</i> in their place). The posthumous 1777 publication departs from this proof in a handful of ways — notably in the absence of several paragraph breaks — and there is no evidence that these changes were ever sanctioned by Hume.</p>
<p>The copytext for the remaining essays — i.e. those published in earlier collections, but withdrawn from the 1777 edition of the <i>Essays and Treatises</i> — is in each case the <em>latest</em> published version.</p>
<p>The only potentially controversial decision here is the selection, for all of the texts contained within it, of the 1777 edition of the <i>Essays and Treatises</i>, rather than the 1772 edition of the same. Hume took great pains over correcting his texts, and there is no doubt that these last two editions are the most authoritative. The 1777 incorporates some corrections made shortly before his death in 1776 (e.g. a substantial deletion from section 3 of the first <i>Enquiry</i>, and a new paragraph added near the end of section 3 of the <i>Dissertation on the Passions</i>), and has traditionally been taken as the copytext of choice. The Green and Grose edition of Hume’s collected works follows this edition, as does Selby-Bigge’s edition (later re-edited by Nidditch) of the two <i>Enquiries</i>. Miller’s edition of the <i>Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary</i> does likewise.</p>
<p>Beauchamp, however, in his recent critical editions of the two <i>Enquiries</i>, the <i>Natural History of Religion</i>, and the <i>Dissertation on the Passions</i>, has preferred the 1772 edition, on the grounds that this was “the last edition to be seen through the press with Hume’s supervision”. While not disputing Beauchamp’s general editorial principles and practice (which included properly consulting the 1777 text “for evidence of late authorial changes”, p. cv), we have reverted here to the traditionally preferred 1777 edition, in accordance with Hume’s own expressed satisfaction with his final editorial changes. This also usefully remedies the lack hitherto of a genuinely reliable published text of the second volume of that edition. (Miller’s edition of the <i>Essays</i> is excellent, a considerable improvement on the Green and Grose. Selby-Bigge’s edition of the two <i>Enquiries</i>, however, contains numerous errors (running into thousands), as do the texts of the <i>Natural History of Religion</i> and the <i>Dissertation on the Passions</i> in the Green and Grose.)</p>
<h2>Original Versions</h2>
<p>By default, every text is displayed in its edited form (see below). By deselecting “edited text” at the top of the page, however, you can switch to the original version. (This effects searches as well as the text displayed on the screen.) Original versions aim to be exact reproductions of the copytexts except for the following silent alterations.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rather than preserve the pagination of the copytexts, we have included page references to the most standard modern reference edition; Selby-Bigge and Nidditch for the <i>Treatise</i>, <i>Abstract</i>, and two <i>Enquiries</i>, Miller for the essays and <i>My Own Life</i>, Beauchamp for the <i>Natural History of Religion</i> and the <i>Dissertation on the Passions</i>, and Kemp Smith for the <i>Dialogues</i>. Hyphens preceeding page breaks have been removed.</li>
  <li>Footnote symbols are all converted to numbers, for ease of reference. Footnotes themselves are grouped together at the end of each section, after a horizontal line. Endnotes — in the case of texts from the <i>Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects</i> — are placed immediately following the footnote that refers to them (to save the reader from having to click or scroll needlessly). In the 1777 copytext, endnotes appeared at the very end of each volume, after a heading “NOTES TO THE FIRST VOLUME” or “NOTES TO THE SECOND VOLUME”.</li>
  <li>Footnote anchors and some other cross references appear in red (as opposed to the original black), indicating a link that can be clicked on to move you to the part of the text being referred to.</li>
  <li>Decorative first letters at the beginning of some of Hume’s texts have been changed to large dropped capitals. Dropped capitals at the start of subsequent sections are as in the copytexts.</li>
  <li>Quotation marks are used in the now-standard way, with one at the beginning and one at the end of each quotation. In some original texts, long quotations appear with a quotation mark at the beginning of every line.</li>
  <li>The eighteenth century long “s” (which looks rather like an “f”) has been everywhere replaced with an ordinary “s”. Ligatures (joining letter combinations such as “ct” and “fi”) have been removed. The combinations “æ” and “œ” have, however, been preserved.</li>
  <li>Commas and semicolons do not appear italicised in Hume’s texts, even in the context of a quotation or statement that is otherwise all in italics; we treat this as indicating that italicised commas and semicolons are indistinguishable from non-italicised commas and semicolons in the font used by Hume’s publishers. Since our own fonts are able to distinguish them, however, we have italicised these punctuation marks when they occur within a phrase that is otherwise all italicised. (Note, by contrast, that colons <em>are</em> sometimes italicised in Hume’s texts, typically when they follow an italicised word. The formatting of colons here follows the copytexts.)</li>
  <li>There are two additional features of the original versions that might be departures from the copytexts, though it is difficult to tell. The first arises because an ordinary lower case (short) “s” is indistinguishable, in the font used by Hume’s publishers, from an “s” in small capitals. This raises the question, when a name appears in small capitals, followed by an apostrophe and an “s”, whether the trailing “s” should be in small capitals or not. We have here taken the view that the capitalisation should apply only to the name itself, since this seems most logical and is also supported by Hume’s texts in the parallel case when names appear in italics, followed by an apostrophe and an “s”: in such cases, the “s” is not italicised (see, for example, footnotes 11 and 47 of the <i>Treatise</i>).</li>
  <li>The second additional feature concerns the placing of footnote anchors in the text. Sometimes these appear between two words, and at a roughly equal distance between the two. It is therefore unclear whether the anchor is meant to be placed at the end of the first word, the start of the second, or in the middle (with a space on either side). To avoid difficult decisions of this kind, and because the issue involves only a typographical convention with no significance for the understanding of the text, in every case we have simply placed the anchor at the end of the first word, in accordance with modern practice.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Edited Versions</h2>
<p>The edited versions available on this site differ from the copytexts in various ways particular to each text; for details of these particular departures, see the notes for each individual text. On the whole, our policy has been to keep editorial interventions to a minimum, and almost all our changes are those sanctioned by Hume himself (e.g. from ERRATA sheets, appendices, or written corrections in his own hand), or obvious typographical errors not present in editions other than the copytext.</p>
<p>In any event, differences between the edited version and the original version can be inspected <i>in situ</i> by checking the “Show Changes” option at the top of the page. Hovering over any such change with the mouse will then bring up a brief comment describing and justifying the change.</p>
<h2>Footnotes and Endnotes</h2>
<p>In respect of those texts that were included within the 1777 <i>Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects</i>, we continue to draw a distinction between notes that appeared as footnotes in the copytext and those that appeared as endnotes. Since no other modern edition draws any such distinction, and even Beauchamp’s (otherwise excellent) critical editions fail to indicate which notes took each form, our policy is perhaps worth discussing in a bit more detail.</p>
<p>In editions of the <i>Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects</i> prior to 1770, all Hume’s notes appeared as footnotes, but in his three last editions (1770, 1772 and 1777), he moved most of the larger notes to a separate section at the end of each volume. That he took an interest in such matters is clear from his letters, in particular to his printer William Strahan on 8th April 1776:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I am very much taken with Mr Gibbon’s Roman History which came from your press ... I intended to have given him my Advice with regard to the manner of printing it ... One is ... plagued with his Notes, according to the present Method of printing the Book: When a note is announced, you turn to the End of the Volume; and there you often find nothing but the Reference to an Authority. All these Authorities ought only to be printed at the Margin on the Bottom of the Page. I desire, that a Copy of my new Edition [i.e. the posthumous edition then in preparation] should be sent to Mr Gibbon, as wishing that a Gentleman, whom I so highly value, shoud peruse me in the form the least imperfect, to which I can bring my work. (HL&nbsp;ii 313)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another letter to Strahan of 8th June, Hume reports the seriousness of his illness, and makes some last requests concerning the printing of <i>My Own Life</i> in his forthcoming edition, and the future publication of the <i>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</i>. Here again he expresses enthusiasm for the quality of what would become the 1777 edition of the <i>Essays and Treatises</i>, and the 1778 edition of the <i>History of England</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I am glad to find, that you have been able to set about this New Edition in earnest. I have made it extremely correct; at least I believe that, if I were to live twenty Years longer, I shoud never be able to give it any further Improvements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence the policy followed here, of carefully following that 1777 edition for all the relevant texts, including its distinction between footnotes and endnotes, with footnotes being used for references to “Authorities” and other relatively short comments, and endnotes generally containing the longer material. Whether the distinction has any deeper significance is now open for the reader to judge, but since some footnotes are longer than many of the endnotes, this at least suggests that length was not Hume’s only criterion.</p>
