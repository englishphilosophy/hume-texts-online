## Posthumous Works

Hume's posthumous works include the *Dialogues concerning Natural Religion* and the two scandalous essays *Of Suicide* and *Of the Immortality of the Soul*. Also his autobiographical *My Own Life*, which was to be included in the 1777 edition of his *Essays and Treatises*, but in the end was published separately in the same year.
