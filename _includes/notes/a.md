## Abstract of the Treatise (1740)

_edited by Peter Millican_

The *Abstract*, now generally agreed to have been composed by Hume himself, was published anonymously in March 1740 in an attempt to promote and explicate Books 1 and 2 of the *Treatise of Human Nature*, which had been published in January 1739. A valuable resource with elegant and concise presentations of some of Hume's principal arguments, it also indicates which of them he took to be most central and important to his philosophical project. It is striking and significant that the structure, focus, and ordering of the *Abstract*, though ostensibly following the "Chief Argument" of the *Treatise*, actually bears much closer resemblance to a quite different work, the first *Enquiry*, which was still eight years away. For detailed discussion of this matter, setting it in a wider context, see my essay "The Context, Aims, and Structure of Hume's First Enquiry" (chapter 1 of Peter Millican, ed., *Reading Hume on Human Understanding*, OUP, 2002).

The text here is taken from the original 1740 edition. Some alterations have been made to the copytext, in line with some comments in Hume's hand made on a copy held at the British Library.
