## Other Collections

Volume 1 of the *Essays and Treatises* started life as a set of *Essays, Moral and Political* (1741-2), and then a set of *Political Discourses* (1752). These collections are also included here (though the essays themselves are typically taken from later editions), partly for the sake of interest, and partly because 8 essays from the original *Essays, Moral and Political* were withdrawn from later editions of the *Essays and Treatises*, and hence are not included in that collection. For ease, there are included in a special collection called *Essays, Moral and Political [withdrawn essays]*.

Also included in here are the *Four Dissertations* of 1757, namely the *Natural History of Religion*, the *Dissertation on the Passions*, *Of Tragedy*, and *Of the Standard of Taste*, together with the *Dedication* to John Home that Hume had prefixed to several copies of this collection.
