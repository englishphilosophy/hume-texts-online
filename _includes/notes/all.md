## Hume Texts Online

The Hume texts on this site are grouped into various collections, partly for ease of navigation, but also to provide helpful groupings to search within. The four main groups are as follows:

### Early Works (1739-45)

Mainly comprising the three books of the *Treatise of Human Nature*, this collection also includes Hume's *Abstract* of the *Treatise* and the *Letter from a Gentleman*, which discuss the topics of the *Treatise* itself.

### Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects (1758, 1777)

Volume 1 of this collection contains the majority of Hume's essays, and all those that he was happy with at the end of his life. Volume 2 contains the major post-*Treatise* philosophical works, namely the *Enquiry concerning Human Understanding*, the *Dissertation on the Passions*, the *Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals*, and the *Natural History of Religion*.

### Posthumous Works

Hume's posthumous works include the *Dialogues concerning Natural Religion* and the two scandalous essays *Of Suicide* and *Of the Immortality of the Soul*. Also his autobiographical *My Own Life*, which was to be included in the 1777 edition of his *Essays and Treatises*, but in the end was published separately in the same year.

### Other Collections

Volume 1 of the *Essays and Treatises* started life as a set of *Essays, Moral and Political* (1741-2), and then a set of *Political Discourses* (1752). These collections are also included here (though the essays themselves are typically taken from later editions), partly for the sake of interest, and partly because 8 essays from the original *Essays, Moral and Political* were withdrawn from later editions of the *Essays and Treatises*, and hence are not included in that collection. For ease, there are included in a special collection called *Essays, Moral and Political [withdrawn essays]*.

Also included in here are the *Four Dissertations* of 1757, namely the *Natural History of Religion*, the *Dissertation on the Passions*, *Of Tragedy*, and *Of the Standard of Taste*, together with the *Dedication* to John Home that Hume had prefixed to several copies of this collection.
