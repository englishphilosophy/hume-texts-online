## A Dissertation on the Passions (1757, 1777)

_edited by Amyas Merivale_

More notes on this text will be added soon. In the meantime, note that there is one substantial alteration to the text: it seems clear to me from the context that the word "compassion" in section 3, paragraph 12 should be "dislike". Obviously this changes the sense considerably, and unfortunately, since this is a new paragraph first added in the 1777 edition, there are no other editions to compare. Thus forewarned, readers may judge for themselves.
