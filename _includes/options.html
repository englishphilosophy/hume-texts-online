<p>By default, the edited version of the text is shown (see the notes on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link notes/edited.md %}">Edited Versions</a>). When displaying the edited text, check the &ldquo;Show Changes&rdquo; option to see the editorial interventions we have made. Deletions will appear with a line through them, and additions underlined; by hovering your mouse over the change, you will see a brief explanation of the edit. Our interventions are minimal, consisting mostly of changes sanctioned by Hume himself, together with corrections of just a few very obvious errors.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can deselect the &ldquo;Edited Version&rdquo; option to see the original edition, a faithful reproduction of the copytext save for some systematic and insignificant changes intended to make the text easier to read and navigate (see the notes on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link notes/original.md %}">Original Editions</a>). Note that this affects the text against which your search queries are tested as well, though the option can also be set on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link search.md %}">Search</a> page.</p>
<p>Page numbers from standard editions are shown alongside each paragraph. For paragraphs that range over more than one page, page breaks can be displayed in the text as a pipe symbol (|), by checking &ldquo;Show Page Breaks&rdquo;.</p>
