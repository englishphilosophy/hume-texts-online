## Teaching Materials

This section of the website is currently under development. When completed, it will make available materials that have been used for teaching Hume at the University of Oxford, especially within the upper-year course on Early Modern Philosophy, but also within the postgraduate BPhil. Most of these materials concern the topics covered in Book 1 of Hume's *Treatise of Human Nature* and his *Enquiry concerning Human Understanding*.

### Oxford Lectures on Hume

The following link gives access to three sets of recorded lectures (with 8 hour-long lectures in each set), given in 2010, 2011 and 2018, together with complete handouts of all three (and of a fourth set given in 2021).

- [Peter Millican's Lectures on Hume]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link teaching/lectures.md %})


### Outline of Humean Texts

The following documents are annotated summaries of some of the most important sections of Hume's *Treatise of Human Nature*, provided to aid comprehension while reading his texts. They are intended to be relatively uncontroversial and interpretatively neutral, tied very closely to Hume's own words (though of course that does not mean readers should uncritically accept the readings offered).

- [Overview of *Treatise* Book 1 Part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link teaching/documents/Overview_of_Treatise_1_1.pdf %})
- [Overview of *Treatise* Book 1 Part 3 Sections 1-8]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link teaching/documents/Overview_of_Treatise_1_3_1-8.pdf %})
- [Hume's Argument concerning Induction in *Treatise* 1.3.6]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link teaching/documents/Induction_Treatise_1_3_6.pdf %})

### Analysis of Hume's "Sceptical Texts"

The following documents focus on the texts of the *Treatise* which are - or have been alleged to be - sceptical in intent, attempting to clarify the extent of their scepticism. Though less deliberately neutral than the outlines above, they again aim to stay very close to the texts and to the scholarly consensus.

- [Hume's Sceptical Texts 1: Induction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link teaching/documents/Hume's_Sceptical_Texts_1_Induction.pdf %})
- [Hume's Sceptical Texts 2: Scepticism with Regard to Reason]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link teaching/documents/Hume's_Sceptical_Texts_2_Reason.pdf %})
- [Hume's Sceptical Texts 3: Scepticism with Regard to the Senses]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link teaching/documents/Hume's_Sceptical_Texts_3_Senses.pdf %})
- [Hume's Sceptical Texts 4: Of the Modern Philosophy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link teaching/documents/Hume's_Sceptical_Texts_4_Modern.pdf %})
- [Hume's Sceptical Texts 5: Conclusion of *Treatise* Book 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link teaching/documents/Hume's_Sceptical_Texts_5_Conclusion.pdf %})

### Notes on Particular Topics

The following teaching notes discuss complex topics where interpretative neutrality becomes impossible, because achieving a coherent view requires taking positions and drawing connections between texts and topics. The notes attempt to display balance, but interpretative biases are inevitable!

- [Notes on Hume's Copy Principle]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link teaching/documents/Hume_Notes_Copy_Principle.pdf %})
- [Notes on Hume's Argument(s) concerning Induction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link teaching/documents/Hume_Notes_Induction.pdf %})
