## Teaching Materials

This section of the website is currently under development. When completed, it will make available materials that have been used for teaching Hume at the University of Oxford, especially within the upper-year course on Early Modern Philosophy, but also within the postgraduate BPhil. Most of these materials concern the topics covered in Book 1 of Hume's *Treatise of Human Nature* and his *Enquiry concerning Human Understanding*.

### Oxford Lectures on Hume

The following link gives access to three sets of recorded lectures (with 8 hour-long lectures in each set), given in 2010, 2011 and 2018, together with complete handouts of all three (and of a fourth set given in 2021).

### Teaching Handouts on Hume 

As further materials are added, this section will acquire greater structure, but currently the documents are listed simply on this index page. Their order here reflects the ordering of topics in Hume's *Treatise of Human Nature*.
