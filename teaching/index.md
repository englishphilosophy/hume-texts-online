## Teaching Materials

This section of the website is currently under development. When completed, it will make available materials that have been used for teaching Hume at the University of Oxford, especially within the upper-year course on Early Modern Philosophy, but also within the postgraduate BPhil. Most of these materials concern the topics covered in Book 1 of Hume's *Treatise of Human Nature* and his *Enquiry concerning Human Understanding*.
