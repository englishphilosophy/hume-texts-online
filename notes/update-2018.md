## Update, March 2018

_by Amyas Merivale_

When the Leeds Electronic Text Centre closed in 2011, I continued working on my doctorate full time, and then returned to Oxford to work as a lecturer and outreach officer. Work and family commitments inevitably took over, and for almost six years this site remained unchanged. During that time I learned a lot more about building web sites, however, and I am delighted to have finally found the time to give this site a much-needed overhaul.

- With an entirely new look, the site now works better on small screens and mobile devices.
- The site structure has been simplified, dividing everything into four main areas: [Texts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link index.md %}) (for Hume's texts and associated editorial commentary), [Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link notes/index.md %}) (for help on how to use the site and information on our general editorial policies) and [Scholarship]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link scholarship/index.md %}) (for bibliographies, papers, and links to other resources), and [Search]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link search.md %}) (for interrogating our database of Hume's publications).
- Editorial notes can now be found immediately alongside each text, by clicking on the "Editorial Notes" tab.
- Search functionality has been completely redesigned. The default _simple search_ is for finding specific passages, and it will endeavour to match variant spellings, so as to maximise your chances of finding the passage you want. By switching to _advanced search_, meanwhile, you can interrogate our database of texts for scholarly purposes, using _regular expressions_. See the [Search]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link search.md %}) page for more information.
- The site is now open source. You can view the code that generates these pages, including the database of texts, at [https://github.com/merivale/davidhume.org](https://github.com/merivale/davidhume.org).
