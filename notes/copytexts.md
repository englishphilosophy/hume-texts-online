## Copytexts

The copytexts for the <i>Treatise of Human Nature</i> and the <i>Abstract</i> of the <i>Treatise</i> are the only editions that Hume published (1739 for volumes 1 and 2 of the <i>Treatise</i>, 1740 for volume 3 and the <i>Abstract</i>).

The copytext for the two <i>Enquiries</i>, the <i>Natural History of Religion</i>, the <i>Dissertation on the Passions</i>, and all of the essays that appeared in this edition, is the posthumous 1777 edition of the <i>Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects</i>.

The copytexts for <i>My Own Life</i> and the <i>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</i> are the (first) posthumous publications of 1777 and 1779 respectively.

The copytext for the two essays <i>Of Suicide</i> and <i>Of the Immortality of the Soul</i> is the proof copy of the <i>Four Dissertations</i> held in the National Library of Scotland (this collection was to include these scandalous essays, before Hume suppressed them and supplied the essay <i>Of the Standard of Taste</i> in their place). The posthumous 1777 publication departs from this proof in a handful of ways — notably in the absence of several paragraph breaks — and there is no evidence that these changes were ever sanctioned by Hume.

The copytext for the remaining essays — i.e. those published in earlier collections, but withdrawn from the 1777 edition of the <i>Essays and Treatises</i> — is in each case the <em>latest</em> published version.

The only potentially controversial decision here is the selection, for all of the texts contained within it, of the 1777 edition of the <i>Essays and Treatises</i>, rather than the 1772 edition of the same. Hume took great pains over correcting his texts, and there is no doubt that these last two editions are the most authoritative. The 1777 incorporates some corrections made shortly before his death in 1776 (e.g. a substantial deletion from section 3 of the first <i>Enquiry</i>, and a new paragraph added near the end of section 3 of the <i>Dissertation on the Passions</i>), and has traditionally been taken as the copytext of choice. The Green and Grose edition of Hume’s collected works follows this edition, as does Selby-Bigge’s edition (later re-edited by Nidditch) of the two <i>Enquiries</i>. Miller’s edition of the <i>Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary</i> does likewise.

Beauchamp, however, in his recent critical editions of the two <i>Enquiries</i>, the <i>Natural History of Religion</i>, and the <i>Dissertation on the Passions</i>, has preferred the 1772 edition, on the grounds that this was “the last edition to be seen through the press with Hume’s supervision”. While not disputing Beauchamp’s general editorial principles and practice (which included properly consulting the 1777 text “for evidence of late authorial changes”, p. cv), we have reverted here to the traditionally preferred 1777 edition, in accordance with Hume’s own expressed satisfaction with his final editorial changes. This also usefully remedies the lack hitherto of a genuinely reliable published text of the second volume of that edition. (Miller’s edition of the <i>Essays</i> is excellent, a considerable improvement on the Green and Grose. Selby-Bigge’s edition of the two <i>Enquiries</i>, however, contains numerous errors (running into thousands), as do the texts of the <i>Natural History of Religion</i> and the <i>Dissertation on the Passions</i> in the Green and Grose.)
