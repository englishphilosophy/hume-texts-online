A man, who is free from mistakes, can pretend to no praises, except from the justness of his understanding: But a man, who corrects his mistakes, shews at once the justness of his understanding, and the candour and ingenuity of his temper. I have not yet been so fortunate as to discover any very considerable mistakes in the reasonings deliver’d in the preceding volumes, except on one article: But I have found by experience, that some of my expressions have not been so well chosen, as to guard against all mistakes in the readers; and ’tis chiefly to remedy this defect, I have subjoin’d the following appendix.</p>"

    content: "<p><b>We</b> can never be induc’d to believe any matter of fact, except where its cause, or its effect, is present to us; but what the nature is of that belief, which arises from the relation of cause and effect, few have had the curiosity to ask themselves. In my opinion, this dilemma is inevitable. Either the belief is some new idea, such as that of <em>reality</em> or <em>existence</em>, which we join to the simple conception of an object, or it is merely a peculiar <em>feeling</em> or <em>sentiment</em>. That it is not a new idea, annex’d to the simple conception, may be evinc’d from these two arguments. <em>First</em>, We have no abstract idea of existence, distinguishable and separable from the idea of particular objects. ’Tis impossible, therefore, that this idea of existence can be annex’d to the idea of any object, or form the difference betwixt a simple conception and belief. <em>Secondly</em>, The mind has the command over all its ideas, and <SBN#624>can separate, unite, mix, and vary them, as it pleases; so that if belief consisted merely in a new idea, annex’d to the conception, it wou’d be in a man’s power to believe what he pleas’d. We may, therefore, conclude, that belief consists merely in a certain feeling or sentiment; in something, that depends not on the will, but must arise from certain determinate causes and principles, of which we are not masters. When we are convinc’d of any matter of fact, we do nothing but conceive it, along with a certain feeling, different from what attends the mere <em>reveries</em> of the imagination. And when we express our incredulity concerning any fact, we mean, that the arguments for the fact produce not that feeling. Did not the belief consist in a sentiment different from our mere conception, whatever objects were presented by the wildest imagination, wou’d be on an equal footing with the most establish’d truths founded on history and experience. There is nothing but the feeling, or sentiment, to distinguish the one from the other.</p>"

    content: "<p><b>This</b>, therefore, being regarded as an undoubted truth, <em>that belief is nothing but a peculiar feeling, different from the simple conception</em>, the next question, that naturally occurs, is, <em>what is the nature of this feeling, or sentiment, and whether it be analogous to any other sentiment of the human mind?</em> This question is important. For if it be not analogous to any other sentiment, we must despair of explaining its causes, and must consider it as an original principle of the human mind. If it be analogous, we may hope to explain its causes from analogy, and trace it up to more general principles. Now that there is a greater firmness and solidity in the conceptions, which are the objects of conviction and assurance, than in the loose and indolent reveries of a castle-builder, every one will readily own. They strike upon us with more force; they are more present to us; the mind has a firmer hold of them, and is more actuated and mov’d by them. It acquiesces in them; and, in a manner, fixes and reposes itself on them. In short, they approach nearer to the im<SBN#625>pressions, which are immediately present to us; and are therefore analogous to many other operations of the mind.</p>"

    content: "<p><b>There</b> is not, in my opinion, any possibility of evading this conclusion, but by asserting, that belief, beside the simple conception, consists in some impression or feeling, distinguishable from the conception. It does not modify the conception, and render it more present and intense: It is only annex’d to it, after the same manner that <em>will</em> and <em>desire</em> are annex’d to particular conceptions of good and pleasure. But the following considerations will, I hope, be sufficient to remove this hypothesis. <em>First</em>, It is directly contrary to experience, and our immediate consciousness. All men have ever allow’d reasoning to be merely an operation of our thoughts or ideas; and however those ideas may be varied to the feeling, there is nothing ever enters into our <em>conclusions</em> but ideas, or our fainter conceptions. For instance; I hear at present a person’s voice, whom I am acquainted with; and this sound comes from the next room. This impression of my senses immediately conveys my thoughts to the person, along with all the surrounding objects. I paint them out to myself as existent at present, with the same qualities and relations, that I formerly knew them possess’d of. These ideas take faster hold of my mind, than the ideas of an inchanted castle. They are different to the feeling; but there is no distinct or separate impression attending them. ’Tis the same case when I recollect the several incidents of a journey, or the events of any history. Every particular fact is there the object of belief. Its idea is modified differently from the loose reveries of a castle-builder: But no distinct impression attends every distinct idea, or conception of matter of fact. This is the subject of plain experience. If ever this experience can be disputed on any occasion, ’tis when the mind has been agitated with doubts and difficulties; and afterwards, upon taking the object in a new point of view, or being presented with a new argument, fixes and reposes itself in one settled conclusion and belief. In this <SBN#626>case there is a feeling distinct and separate from the conception. The passage from doubt and agitation to tranquility and repose, conveys a satisfaction and pleasure to the mind. But take any other case. Suppose I see the legs and thighs of a person in motion, while some interpos’d object conceals the rest of his body. Here ’tis certain, the imagination spreads out the whole figure. I give him a head and shoulders, and breast and neck. These members I conceive and believe him to be possess’d of. Nothing can be more evident, than that this whole operation is perform’d by the thought or imagination alone. The transition is immediate. The ideas presently strike us. Their customary connexion with the present impression, varies them and modifies them in a certain manner, but produces no act of the mind, distinct from this peculiarity of conception. Let any one examine his own mind, and he will evidently find this to be the truth.</p>"

    content: "<p><em>Thirdly</em>, We can explain the <em>causes</em> of the firm conception, but not those of any separate impression. And not only so, but the causes of the firm conception exhaust the whole subject, and nothing is left to produce any other effect. An inference concerning a matter of fact is nothing but the idea of an object, that is frequently conjoin’d, or is associated with a present impression. This is the whole of it. Every part is requisite to explain, from analogy, the more steady conception; and nothing remains capable of producing any distinct impression.</p>"

The transition from a present impression, always enlivens and strengthens any idea. When any object is presented, the idea of its usual attendant immediately strikes us, as something real and solid. ’Tis <em>felt</em>, rather than conceiv’d, and approaches the impression, from which it is deriv’d, in its force and influence. This I have prov’d at large. I cannot add any new arguments; tho’ perhaps my reasoning on this whole question, concerning cause and effect, wou’d have been more convincing, had the following passages been inserted in the places, which I have mark’d for them.

If perceptions are distinct existences, they form a whole only by being connected together. But no connexions among distinct existences are ever discoverable by human understanding. We only <em>feel</em> a connexion or determination of the thought, to pass from one object to another. It follows, therefore, that the thought alone finds personal identity, when reflecting on the train of past perceptions, that compose a mind, the ideas of them are felt to be connected together, and naturally introduce each other. However extraordinary this conclusion may seem, it need not surprize us. Most philosophers seem inclin’d to think, that personal identity <em>arises</em> from consciousness; and consciousness is nothing but a reflected thought or perception. The present philosophy, therefore, has so far a promising aspect. But all my hopes vanish, when I come <SBN#636>to explain the principles, that unite our successive perceptions in our thought or consciousness.

    content: "<p>One might think it were entirely superfluous to prove this, if a late author, who has had the good fortune to obtain some reputation, had not seriously affirmed, that such a falshood is the foundation of all guilt and moral deformity. That we may discover the fallacy of his hypothesis, we need only consider, that a false conclusion is drawn from an action, only by means of an obscurity of natural principles, which makes a cause be secretly interrupted in its operation, by contrary causes, and renders the connection betwixt two objects uncertain and variable. Now, as a like uncertainty and variety of causes take place, even in natural objects, and produce a like error in our judgment, if that tendency to produce error were the very essence of vice and immorality, it shou’d follow, that even inanimate objects might be vicious and immoral. <br><span class='tab'></span>’Tis in vain to urge, that inanimate objects act without liberty and choice. For as liberty and choice are not necessary to make an action produce in us an erroneous conclusion, they can be, in no respect, essential to morality; and I do not readily perceive, upon this system, how they can ever come to be regarded by it. If the tendency to cause error be the origin of immorality, that tendency and immorality wou’d in every case be inseparable. <br><span class='tab'></span>Add to this, that if I had used the precaution of shutting the windows, while I indulg’d myself in those liberties with my neighbour’s wife, I should have been guilty of no immorality; and that because my action, being perfectly conceal’d, wou’d have had no tendency to produce any false conclusion. <SBN#462><br><span class='tab'></span>For the same reason, a thief, who steals in by a ladder at a window, and takes all imaginable care to cause no disturbance, is in no respect criminal. For either he will not be perceiv’d, or if he be, ’tis impossible he can produce any error, nor will any one, from these circumstances, take him to be other than what he really is. <br><span class='tab'></span>’Tis well known, that those who are squint-sighted, do very readily cause mistakes in others, and that we imagine they salute or are talking to one person, while they address themselves to another. Are they therefore, upon that account, immoral? <br><span class='tab'></span>Besides, we may easily observe, that in all those arguments there is an evident reasoning in a circle. A person who takes possession of <em>another</em>’s goods, and uses them as his <em>own</em>, in a manner declares them to be his own; and this falshood is the source of the immorality of injustice. But is property, or right, or obligation, intelligible, without an antecedent morality? <br><span class='tab'></span>A man that is ungrateful to his benefactor, in a manner affirms, that he never received any favours from him. But in what manner? Is it because ’tis his duty to be grateful? But this supposes, that there is some antecedent rule of duty and morals. Is it because human nature is generally grateful, and makes us conclude, that a man who does any harm never received any favour from the person he harm’d? But human nature is not so generally grateful, as to justify such a conclusion. Or if it were, is an exception to a general rule in every case criminal, for no other reason than because it is an exception? <br><span class='tab'></span>But what may suffice entirely to destroy this whimsical system is, that it leaves us under the same difficulty to give a reason why truth is virtuous and falshood vicious, as to account for the merit or turpitude of any other action. I shall allow, if you please, that all immorality is derived from this supposed falsehood in action, provided you can give me any plausible reason, why such a falshood is immoral. If you consider rightly of the matter, you will find yourself in the same difficulty as at the beginning. <br><span class='tab'></span>This last argument is very conclusive; because, if there be not an evident merit or turpitude annex’d to this species of truth or falshood, it can never have any influence upon our actions. For, who ever thought of forbearing any action, because others might possibly draw false conclusions from it? Or, who ever perform’d any, that he might give rise to true conclusions?</p>"

    content: "<p>As a proof, how confus’d our way of thinking on this subject commonly is, we may observe, that those who assert, that morality is demonstrable, do not say, that morality lies in the relations, and that the relations are distinguishable by reason. They only say, that reason can discover such an action, in such relations, to be virtuous, and such another vicious. It seems they thought it sufficient, if they cou’d bring the word, Relation, into the proposition, without troubling themselves whether it was to the purpose or not. But here, I think, is plain argument. Demonstrative reason discovers only relations. But that reason, according to this hypothesis, discovers also vice and virtue. These moral qualities, therefore, must be relations. When we blame any action, in any situation, the whole complicated object, of action and situation, must form certain relations, wherein the essence of vice consists. This hypothesis is not otherwise intelligible. For what does reason discover, when it pronounces any action vicious? Does it discover a relation or a matter of fact? These questions are decisive, and must not be eluded.</p>"

    content: "<p>No questions in philosophy are more difficult, than when a number of causes present themselves for the same phænomenon, to determine which is the principal and predominant. There seldom is any very precise argument to fix our choice, and men must be contented to be guided by a kind of taste or fancy, arising from analogy, and a comparison of similar instances. Thus, in the present case, there are, no doubt, motives of public interest for most of the rules, which determine property; but still I suspect, that these rules are principally fix’d by the imagination, or the more frivolous properties of our thought and conception. I shall continue to explain these causes, leaving it to the reader’s choice, whether he will prefer those deriv’d from publick utility, or those deriv’d from the imagination. We shall begin with the right of the present possessor. <br><span class='tab'></span>’Tis a quality, which (<em>a</em>) I have already observ’d in human nature, that when two objects appear in a close relation to each other, the mind is apt to ascribe to them any additional relation, in order to compleat the union; and this inclination is so strong, as often to make us run into errors (such as that of the conjunction of thought and matter) if we find that they can serve to that purpose. Many of our impressions are incapable of place or local position; and yet those very impressions we suppose to have a local conjunction with the impressions of sight and touch, merely because they are conjoin’d by causation, and are already united in the imagination. Since, therefore, we can feign a new relation, and even an absurd one, in order to compleat any union, ’twill easily be imagin’d, that if there be any relations, which depend on the mind, ’twill readily conjoin them to any preceding relation, and unite, by a new bond, such objects as have already an union in the fancy. Thus for instance, we never fail, in our arrangement of bodies, to place those which are <em>resembling</em> in <em>contiguity</em> to each other, or at least in <em>correspondent</em> points of view; because we feel a satisfaction in joining the relation of contiguity to that of resemblance, or the resemblance of situation to that of qualities. And this is easily accounted for from the known properties of human nature. When the mind is determin’d to join certain objects, but undetermin’d in its choice of the particular objects, it naturally turns its eye to such as are related together. They are already united in the mind: They present themselves at the same time to the conception; and instead of requiring any new reason for their conjunction, it wou’d require a very powerful reason to make us over-look this natural affinity. This we shall have occasion to explain more fully afterwards, when we come to treat of <em>beauty</em>. In the mean time, we may content ourselves with observing, that the same love of order and uniformity, which arranges the books in a library, and the chairs in a parlour, contributes to the formation of society, and to the well-being of mankind, by modifying the general rule concerning the stability of possession. <del>And as</del><ins title='originally 'And as'; manuscript deletion'>As</ins> property forms a relation betwixt a person and an object, ’tis natural to found it on some preceding relation; and as property is nothing but a constant possession, secur’d by the laws <SBN#505>of society, ’tis natural to add it to the present possession, which is a relation that resembles it. For this also has its influence. If it be natural to conjoin all sorts of relations, ’tis more so, to conjoin such relations as are resembling, and are related together.</p>"

The difficulties on this head must encrease, when we consider, that our judgment alters very sensibly, according to the subject, and that the same power and proximity will be deem’d possession in one case, which is not esteem’d such in another. A person, who has hunted a hare to the last degree of weariness, wou’d look upon it as an injustice for another to rush in before him, and seize his prey. But the same person, advancing to pluck an apple, that hangs within his reach, has no reason to complain, if another, more alert, passes <SBN#507>him, and takes possession. What is the reason of this difference, but that immobility, not being natural to the hare, but the effect of industry, forms in that case a strong relation with the hunter, which is wanting in the other? <br><span class='tab'></span>Here then it appears, that a certain and infallible power of enjoyment, without touch or some other sensible relation, often produces not property: And I farther observe, that a sensible relation, without any present power, is sometimes sufficient to give a title to any object. The sight of a thing is seldom a considerable relation, and is only regarded as such, when the object is hidden, or very obscure; in which case we find, that the view alone conveys a property; according to that maxim, <em>that even a whole continent belongs to the nation, which first discover’d it</em>. ’Tis however remarkable, that both in the case of discovery and that of possession, the first discoverer and possessor must join to the relation an intention of rendering himself proprietor, otherwise the relation will not have its effect; and that because the connexion in our fancy betwixt the property and the relation is not so great, but that it requires to be help’d by such an intention. <br><span class='tab'></span>From all these circumstances, ’tis easy to see how perplex’d many questions may become concerning the acquisition of property by occupation; and the least effort of thought may present us with instances, which are not susceptible of any reasonable decision.

To know the truth of this report, they dispatch’d at once <SBN#508>two messengers, one from each colony; who finding on their approach, that their information was true, begun a race together with an intention to take possession of the city, each of them for his countrymen. One of these messengers, finding that he was not an equal match for the other, launch’d his spear at the gates of the city, and was so fortunate as to fix it there before the arrival of his companion. This produc’d a dispute betwixt the two colonies, which of them was the proprietor of the empty city; and this dispute still subsists among philosophers. For my part I find the dispute impossible to be decided, and that because the whole question hangs upon the fancy, which in this case is not possess’d of any precise or determinate standard, upon which it can give sentence. <del> </del><ins title='the paragraph break here is a manuscript alteration'><br><span class='tab'></span></ins>To make this evident, let us consider, that if these two persons had been simply members of the colonies, and not messengers or deputies, their actions wou’d not have been of any consequence; since in that case their relation to the colonies wou’d have been but feeble and imperfect. Add to this, that nothing determin’d them to run to the gates rather than the walls, or any other part of the city, but that the gates, being the most obvious and remarkable part, satisfy the fancy best in taking them for the whole; as we find by the poets, who frequently draw their images and metaphors from them. Besides we may consider, that the touch or contact of the one messenger is not properly possession, no more than the piercing the gates with a spear; but only forms a relation; and there is a relation, in the other case, equally obvious, tho’ not, perhaps, of equal force. Which of these relations, then, conveys a right and property, or whether any of them be sufficient for that effect, I leave to the decision of such as are wiser than myself.</p>"

    content: "<p>This source of property can never be explain’d but from the imaginations; and one may affirm, that the causes are here unmix’d. We shall proceed to explain them more particularly, and illustrate them by examples from common life and experience. <br><span class='tab'></span>It has been observ’d above, that the mind has a natural propensity to join relations, especially resembling ones, and finds a kind of fitness and uniformity in such an union. From this propensity are deriv’d these laws of nature, <em>that upon the first formation of society, property always follows the present possession</em>; and afterwards, <em>that it arises from first or from long possession</em>. Now we may easily observe, that relation is not confin’d merely to one degree; but that from an object, that is related to us, we acquire a relation to every other object, which is related to it, and so on, till the thought loses the chain by too long a progress. However the relation may weaken by each remove, ’tis not immediately destroy’d; but frequently connects two objects by means of an intermediate one, which is related to both. And this principle is of such force as to give rise to the right of <em>accession</em>, and causes us to acquire the property not only of such objects as we are immediately possess’d of, but also of such as are closely connected with them. <br><span class='tab'></span>Suppose a <em>German</em>, a <em>Frenchman</em>, and a <em>Spaniard</em> to come into a room where there are plac’d upon the table three bottles of wine, <SBN#510><em>Rhenish</em>, <em>Burgundy</em> and <em>Port</em>; and suppose they shou’d fall a quarrelling about the division of them; a person, who was chosen for umpire, wou’d naturally, to shew his impartiality, give every one the product of his own country: And this from a principle, which, in some measure, is the source of those laws of nature, that ascribe property to occupation, prescription and accession. <br><span class='tab'></span>In all these cases, and particularly that of accession, there is first a <em>natural</em> union betwixt the idea of the person and that of the object, and afterwards a new and  <em>moral</em> union produc’d by that right or property, which we ascribe to the person. But here there occurs a difficulty, which merits our attention, and may afford us an opportunity of putting to tryal that singular method of reasoning, which has been employ’d on the present subject. I have already observ’d, that the imagination passes with greater facility from little to great, than from great to little, and that the transition of ideas is always easier and smoother in the former case than in the latter. Now as the right of accession arises from the easy transition of ideas, by which related objects are connected together, it shou’d naturally be imagin’d, that the right of accession must encrease in strength, in proportion as the transition of ideas is perform’d with greater facility. It may, therefore, be thought, that when we have acquir’d the property of any small object, we shall readily consider any great object related to it as an accession, and as belonging to the proprietor of the small one; since the transition is in that case very easy from the small object to the great one, and shou’d connect them together in the closest manner. But in fact the case is always found to be otherwise. The empire of <em>Great Britain</em> seems to draw along with it the dominion of the <em>Orkneys</em>, the  <em>Hebrides</em>, the isle of <em>Man</em>, and the isle of <em>Wight</em>; but the authority over those lesser islands does not naturally imply any title to  <em>Great Britain</em>. In short, a small object naturally follows a great one as its accession; but a great one is never suppos’d to belong to the proprietor of a small one related to it, merely on account of that property and relation. Yet in this latter case the transition of ideas is smoother from the proprietor to the small object, which is his property, and from the small object to the great one, than in the former case from the proprietor to the great object, and from the great one to the small. It may therefore be thought, that these phænomena are objections to the foregoing hypothesis, <em>that the ascribing of property to accession is nothing but an <del>affect</del><ins title='originally 'affect'; clearly an error'>effect</ins> of the relations of ideas, and of the smooth transition of the imagination</em>. <br><span class='tab'></span>’Twill be easy to solve this objection, if we consider the agility and unsteadiness of the imagination, with the different views, in which it is continually placing its objects. When we attribute to a person a property in two objects, we do not always pass from the person to one object, and from that to the other related to it. The objects being here to be consider’d as the property of the person, we are apt to join them <SBN#511>together, and place them in the same light. Suppose, therefore, a great and a small object to be related together; if a person be strongly related to the great object, he will likewise be strongly related to both the objects, consider’d together, because be is related to the most considerable part. On the contrary, if he be only related to the small object, he will not be strongly related to both, consider’d together, since his relation lies only with the most trivial part, which is not apt to strike us in any great degree, when we consider the whole. And this is the reason, why small objects become accessions to great ones, and not great to small. <br><span class='tab'></span>’Tis the general opinion of philosophers and civilians, that the sea is incapable of becoming the property of any nation; and that because ’tis impossible to take possession of it, or form any such distinct relation with it, as may be the foundation of property. Where this reason ceases, property immediately takes place. Thus the most strenuous advocates for the liberty of the seas universally allow, that friths and bays naturally belong as an accession to the proprietors of the surrounding continent. These have properly no more bond or union with the land, than the <em>pacific</em> ocean wou’d have; but having an union in the fancy, and being at the same time <em>inferior</em>, they are of course regarded as an accession. <br><span class='tab'></span>The property of rivers, by the laws of most nations, and by the natural turn of our thought, is attributed to the proprietors of their banks, excepting such vast rivers as the <em>Rhine</em> or the <em>Danube</em>, which seem too large to the imagination to follow as an accession the property of the neighbouring fields. Yet even these rivers are consider’d as the property of that nation, thro’ whose dominions they run; the idea of a nation being of a suitable bulk to correspond with them, and bear them such a relation in the fancy. <br><span class='tab'></span>The accessions, which are made to lands bordering upon rivers, follow the land, say the civilians, provided <del>it</del><ins title='originally 'it'; manuscript alteration'>they</ins> be made by what they call <em>alluvion</em>, that is, insensibly and imperceptibly; which are circumstances that mightily assist the imagination in the conjunction. Where there is any considerable portion torn at once from one bank, and join’d to another, it becomes not his property, whose land it falls on, till it unite with the land, and till the trees or plants have spread their roots into both. Before that, the imagination does not sufficiently join them. <br><span class='tab'></span>There are other cases, which somewhat resemble this of accession, but which, at the bottom, are considerably different, and merit our attention. Of this kind is the conjunction of the properties of different persons, after such a manner as not to admit of <em>separation</em>. The question is, to whom the united mass must belong. <br><span class='tab'></span>Where this conjunction is of such a nature as to admit of <em>division</em>, but not of <em>separation</em>, the decision is natural and easy. The whole mass must be suppos’d to be common betwixt the proprietors of the <SBN#512>several parts, and afterwards must be divided according to the proportions of these parts. But here I cannot forbear taking notice of a remarkable subtilty of the <em>Roman</em> law, in distinguishing betwixt <em>confusion</em> and <em>commixtion</em>. Confusion is an union of two bodies, such as different liquors, where the parts become entirely undistinguishable. Commixtion is the blending of two bodies, such as two bushels of corn, where the parts remain separate in an obvious and visible manner. As in the latter case the imagination discovers not so entire an union as in the former, but is able to trace and preserve a distinct idea of the property of each; this is the reason, why the <em>civil</em> law, tho’ it establish’d an entire community in the case of <em>confusion</em>, and after that a proportional division, yet in the case of <em>commixtion</em>, supposes each of the proprietors to maintain a distinct right; however necessity may at last force them to submit to the same division. <br><span class='tab'></span><em>Quod si frumentum Titii frumento tuo mistum fuerit: siquidem ex voluntate vestra, commune est: quia singula corpora, id est, singula grana, quæ cujusque propria fuerunt, ex consensu vestro communicata sunt. Quod si casu id mistum fuerit, vel Titius id miscuerit sine tua voluntate, non videtur id commune esse; quia singula corpora in sua substantia durant. Sed nec magis istis casibus commune sit frumentum quam grex intelligitur esse communis, si pecora Titii tuis pecoribus mista fuerint. Sed si ab alterutro vestrûm totum id frumentum retineatur, in rem quidem actio pro modo frumenti cujusque competit. Arbitrio autem judicis, ut ipse æstimet quale cujusque frumentum fuerit.</em> Inst. Lib. II. Tit. 1. §. 28. <br><span class='tab'></span>Where the properties of two persons are united after such a manner as neither to admit of <em>division</em> nor <em>separation</em>, as when one builds a house on another’s ground, in that case, the whole must belong to one of the proprietors: And here I assert, that it naturally is conceiv’d to belong to the proprietor of the most considerable part. For however the compound object may have a relation to two different persons, and carry our view at once to both of them, yet as the most considerable part principally engages our attention, and by the strict union draws the inferior along it; for this reason, the whole bears a relation to the proprietor of that part, and is regarded as his property. The only difficulty is, what we shall be pleas’d to call the most considerable part, and most attractive to the imagination. <br><span class='tab'></span>This quality depends on several different circumstances, which have little connexion with each other. One part of a compound object may become more considerable than another, either because it is more constant and durable; because it is of greater value; because it is more obvious and remarkable; because it is of greater extent; or because its existence is more separate and independent. ’Twill be easy to conceive, that, as these circumstances may be conjoin’d and oppos’d in all the different ways, and according to all the different degrees, which can be <SBN#513>imagin’d, there will result many cases, where the reasons on both sides are so equally ballanc’d, that ’tis impossible for us to give any satisfactory decision. Here then is the proper business of municipal laws, to fix what the principles of human nature have left undetermin’d. <br><span class='tab'></span>The superficies yields to the soil, says the civil law: The writing to the paper: The canvas to the picture. These decisions do not well agree together, and are a proof of the contrariety of those principles, from which they are deriv’d. <br><span class='tab'></span>But of all the questions of this kind the most curious is that, which for so many ages divided the disciples of <em>Proculus</em> and <em>Sabinus</em>. Suppose a person shou’d make a cup from the metal of another, or a ship from his wood, and suppose the proprietor of the metal or wood shou’d demand his goods, the question is, whether he acquires a title to the cup or ship. <em>Sabinus</em> maintain’d the affirmative, and asserted that the substance or matter is the foundation of all the qualities; that it is incorruptible and immortal, and therefore superior to the form, which is casual and dependent. On the other hand, <em>Proculus</em> observ’d, that the form is the most obvious and remarkable part, and that from it bodies are denominated of this or that particular species. To which he might have added, that the matter or substance is in most bodies so fluctuating and uncertain, that ’tis utterly impossible to trace it in all its changes. For my part, I know not from what principles such a controversy can be certainly determin’d. I shall therefore content my self with observing, that the decision of <em>Trebonian</em> seems to me pretty ingenious; that the cup belongs to the proprietor of the metal, because it can be brought back to its first form: But that the ship belongs to the author of its form for a contrary reason. But however ingenious this reason may seem, it plainly depends upon the fancy, which by the possibility of such a reduction, finds a closer connexion and relation betwixt a cup and the proprietor of its metal, than betwixt a ship and the proprietor of its wood, where the substance is more fix’d and unalterable.</p>"
