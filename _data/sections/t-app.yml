    text: "^T^HERE is nothing I wou’d more willingly lay hold of, than an opportunity of confessing my errors; and shou’d esteem such a return to truth and reason to be more honourable than the most unerring judgment. A man, who is free from mistakes, can pretend to no praises, except from the justness of his understanding: But a man, who corrects his mistakes, shews at once the justness of his understanding, and the candour and ingenuity of his temper. I have not yet been so fortunate as to discover any very considerable mistakes in the reasonings deliver’d in the preceding volumes, except on one article: But I have found by experience, that some of my expressions have not been so well chosen, as to guard against all mistakes in the readers; and ’tis chiefly to remedy this defect, I have subjoin’d the following appendix."

    text: "*We* can never be induc’d to believe any matter of fact, except where its cause, or its effect, is present to us; but what the nature is of that belief, which arises from the relation of cause and effect, few have had the curiosity to ask themselves. In my opinion, this dilemma is inevitable. Either the belief is some new idea, such as that of _reality_ or _existence_, which we join to the simple conception of an object, or it is merely a peculiar _feeling_ or _sentiment_. That it is not a new idea, annex’d to the simple conception, may be evinc’d from these two arguments. _First_, We have no abstract idea of existence, distinguishable and separable from the idea of particular objects. ’Tis impossible, therefore, that this idea of existence can be annex’d to the idea of any object, or form the difference betwixt a simple conception and belief. _Secondly_, The mind has the command over all its ideas, and <SBN#624>can separate, unite, mix, and vary them, as it pleases; so that if belief consisted merely in a new idea, annex’d to the conception, it wou’d be in a man’s power to believe what he pleas’d. We may, therefore, conclude, that belief consists merely in a certain feeling or sentiment; in something, that depends not on the will, but must arise from certain determinate causes and principles, of which we are not masters. When we are convinc’d of any matter of fact, we do nothing but conceive it, along with a certain feeling, different from what attends the mere _reveries_ of the imagination. And when we express our incredulity concerning any fact, we mean, that the arguments for the fact produce not that feeling. Did not the belief consist in a sentiment different from our mere conception, whatever objects were presented by the wildest imagination, wou’d be on an equal footing with the most establish’d truths founded on history and experience. There is nothing but the feeling, or sentiment, to distinguish the one from the other."

    text: "*This*, therefore, being regarded as an undoubted truth, _that belief is nothing but a peculiar feeling, different from the simple conception_, the next question, that naturally occurs, is, _what is the nature of this feeling, or sentiment, and whether it be analogous to any other sentiment of the human mind?_ This question is important. For if it be not analogous to any other sentiment, we must despair of explaining its causes, and must consider it as an original principle of the human mind. If it be analogous, we may hope to explain its causes from analogy, and trace it up to more general principles. Now that there is a greater firmness and solidity in the conceptions, which are the objects of conviction and assurance, than in the loose and indolent reveries of a castle-builder, every one will readily own. They strike upon us with more force; they are more present to us; the mind has a firmer hold of them, and is more actuated and mov’d by them. It acquiesces in them; and, in a manner, fixes and reposes itself on them. In short, they approach nearer to the im<SBN#625>pressions, which are immediately present to us; and are therefore analogous to many other operations of the mind."

    text: "*There* is not, in my opinion, any possibility of evading this conclusion, but by asserting, that belief, beside the simple conception, consists in some impression or feeling, distinguishable from the conception. It does not modify the conception, and render it more present and intense: It is only annex’d to it, after the same manner that _will_ and _desire_ are annex’d to particular conceptions of good and pleasure. But the following considerations will, I hope, be sufficient to remove this hypothesis. _First_, It is directly contrary to experience, and our immediate consciousness. All men have ever allow’d reasoning to be merely an operation of our thoughts or ideas; and however those ideas may be varied to the feeling, there is nothing ever enters into our _conclusions_ but ideas, or our fainter conceptions. For instance; I hear at present a person’s voice, whom I am acquainted with; and this sound comes from the next room. This impression of my senses immediately conveys my thoughts to the person, along with all the surrounding objects. I paint them out to myself as existent at present, with the same qualities and relations, that I formerly knew them possess’d of. These ideas take faster hold of my mind, than the ideas of an inchanted castle. They are different to the feeling; but there is no distinct or separate impression attending them. ’Tis the same case when I recollect the several incidents of a journey, or the events of any history. Every particular fact is there the object of belief. Its idea is modified differently from the loose reveries of a castle-builder: But no distinct impression attends every distinct idea, or conception of matter of fact. This is the subject of plain experience. If ever this experience can be disputed on any occasion, ’tis when the mind has been agitated with doubts and difficulties; and afterwards, upon taking the object in a new point of view, or being presented with a new argument, fixes and reposes itself in one settled conclusion and belief. In this <SBN#626>case there is a feeling distinct and separate from the conception. The passage from doubt and agitation to tranquility and repose, conveys a satisfaction and pleasure to the mind. But take any other case. Suppose I see the legs and thighs of a person in motion, while some interpos’d object conceals the rest of his body. Here ’tis certain, the imagination spreads out the whole figure. I give him a head and shoulders, and breast and neck. These members I conceive and believe him to be possess’d of. Nothing can be more evident, than that this whole operation is perform’d by the thought or imagination alone. The transition is immediate. The ideas presently strike us. Their customary connexion with the present impression, varies them and modifies them in a certain manner, but produces no act of the mind, distinct from this peculiarity of conception. Let any one examine his own mind, and he will evidently find this to be the truth."

    text: "_Secondly_, Whatever may be the case, with regard to this distinct impression, it must be allow’d, that the mind has a firmer hold, or more steady conception of what it takes to be matter of fact, than of fictions. Why then look any farther, or multiply suppositions without necessity?"
  -
    id: "T App.6"
    text: "_Thirdly_, We can explain the _causes_ of the firm conception, but not those of any separate impression. And not only so, but the causes of the firm conception exhaust the whole subject, and nothing is left to produce any other effect. An inference concerning a matter of fact is nothing but the idea of an object, that is frequently conjoin’d, or is associated with a present impression. This is the whole of it. Every part is requisite to explain, from analogy, the more steady conception; and nothing remains capable of producing any distinct impression."
  -
    id: "T App.7"
    text: "_Fourthly_, The _effects_ of belief, in influencing the passions and imagination, can all be explain’d from the firm conception; and there is no occasion to have recourse to any other principle. These arguments, with many others, enumerated <SBN#627>in the foregoing volumes, sufficiently prove, that belief only modifies the idea or conception; and renders it different to the feeling, without producing any distinct impression."

    id: "T App.8"
    text: "*Thus* upon a general view of the subject, there appear to be two questions of importance, which we may venture to recommend to the consideration of philosophers, _Whether there be any thing to distinguish belief from the simple conception beside the feeling or sentiment?_ And, _Whether this feeling be any thing but a firmer conception, or a faster hold, that we take of the object?_"

    id: "T App.9"
    text: "*If*, upon impartial enquiry, the same conclusion, that I have form’d, be assented to by philosophers, the next business is to examine the analogy, which there is betwixt belief, and other acts of the mind, and find the cause of the firmness and strength of conception: And this I do not esteem a difficult task. The transition from a present impression, always enlivens and strengthens any idea. When any object is presented, the idea of its usual attendant immediately strikes us, as something real and solid. ’Tis _felt_, rather than conceiv’d, and approaches the impression, from which it is deriv’d, in its force and influence. This I have prov’d at large. I cannot add any new arguments; tho’ perhaps my reasoning on this whole question, concerning cause and effect, wou’d have been more convincing, had the following passages been inserted in the places, which I have mark’d for them. I have added a few illustrations on other points, where I thought it necessary.//"

[+[T 1.3.5.3] @added for ease of reference]_ after these words _(fainter and more obscure.)_ beginning a new paragraph._</description>*It* frequently happens, that when two men have been engag’d in any scene of action, the one shall remember it much better than the other, and shall have all the difficulty in the world to make his companion recollect it. He runs over several circumstances in vain; mentions the time, the place, <SBN#628>the company, what was said, what was done on all sides; till at last he hits on some lucky circumstance, that revives the whole, and gives his friend a perfect memory of every thing. Here the person that forgets receives at first all the ideas from the discourse of the other, with the same circumstances of time and place; tho’ he considers them as mere fictions of the imagination. But as soon as the circumstance is mention’d, that touches the memory, the very same ideas now appear in a new light, and have, in a manner, a different feeling from what they had before. Without any other alteration, beside that of the feeling, they become immediately ideas of the memory, and are assented to. //¬*Since*, therefore, the imagination can represent all the same objects that the memory can offer to us, and since those faculties are only distinguish’d by the different _feeling_ of the ideas they present, it may be proper to consider what is the nature of that feeling. And here I believe every one will readily agree with me, that the ideas of the memory are more _strong_ and _lively_ than those of the fancy. A painter, who intended, _&c_.//</app>"

[+[T 1.3.7.6] @added for ease of reference]_ after these words _(according to the foregoing definition.)_ beginning a new paragraph._</description>*This* operation of the mind, which forms the belief of any matter of fact, seems hitherto to have been one of the greatest mysteries of philosophy; tho’ no one has so much as suspected, that there was any difficulty in explaining it. For my part I must own, that I find a considerable difficulty in the case; and that even when I think I understand the subject perfectly, I am at a loss for terms to express my meaning. I conclude, by an induction which seems to me very evident, that an opinion or belief is nothing but an idea, that is different from a fiction, not in the nature, or the order of its parts, but in the _manner_ of its being conceiv’d. But <SBN#629>when I wou’d explain this _manner_, I scarce find any word that fully answers the case, but am oblig’d to have recourse to every one’s feeling, in order to give him a perfect notion of this operation of the mind. An idea assented to _feels_ different from a fictitious idea, that the fancy alone presents to us: And this different feeling I endeavour to explain by calling it a superior _force_, or _vivacity_, or _solidity_, or _firmness_, or _steadiness_. This variety of terms, which may seem so unphilosophical, is intended only to express that act of the mind, which renders realities more present to us than fictions, causes them to weigh more in the thought, and gives them a superior influence on the passions and imagination. Provided we agree about the thing, ’tis needless to dispute about the terms. The imagination has the command over all its ideas, and can join, and mix, and vary them in all the ways possible. It may conceive objects with all the circumstances of place and time. It may set them, in a manner, before our eyes in their true colours, just as they might have existed. But as it is impossible, that that faculty can ever, of itself, reach belief, ’tis evident, that belief consists not in the nature and order of our ideas, but in the manner of their conception, and in their feeling to the mind. I confess, that ’tis impossible to explain perfectly this feeling or manner of conception. We may make use of words, that express something near it. But its true and proper name is _belief_, which is a term that every one sufficiently understands in common life. And in philosophy we can go no farther, than assert, that it is something _felt_ by the mind, which distinguishes the ideas of the judgment from the fictions of the imagination. It gives them more force and influence; makes them appear of greater importance; infixes them in the mind; and renders them the governing principles of all our actions.//</app>"

[+[T 1.3.10.9] @added for ease of reference]_ after these words _(impressions of the senses.)_ beginning a new paragraph._</description>*We* may observe the same effect of poetry in a lesser degree; and this is common both to poetry and madness, that the vivacity they bestow on the ideas is not deriv’d from the particular situations or connexions of the objects of these ideas, but from the present temper and disposition of the person. But how great soever the pitch may be, to which this vivacity rises, ’tis evident, that in poetry it never has the same _feeling_ with that which arises in the mind, when we reason, tho’ even upon the lowest species of probability. The mind can easily distinguish betwixt the one and the other; and whatever emotion the poetical enthusiasm may give to the spirits, ’tis still the mere phantom of belief or persuasion. The case is the same with the idea, as with the passion it occasions. There is no passion of the human <SBN#631>mind but what may arise from poetry; tho’ at the same time the _feelings_ of the passions are very different when excited by poetical fictions, from what they are when they arise from belief and reality. A passion, which is disagreeable in real life, may afford the highest entertainment in a tragedy, or epic poem. In the latter case it lies not with that weight upon us: It feels less firm and solid: And has no other than the agreeable effect of exciting the spirits, and rouzing the attention. The difference in the passions is a clear proof of a like difference in those ideas, from which the passions are deriv’d. Where the vivacity arises from a customary conjunction with a present impression; tho’ the imagination may not, in appearance, be so much mov’d; yet there is always something more forcible and real in its actions, than in the fervors of poetry and eloquence. The force of our mental actions in this case, no more than in any other, is not to be measur’d by the apparent agitation of the mind. A poetical description may have a more sensible effect on the fancy, than an historical narration. It may collect more of those circumstances, that form a compleat image or picture. It may seem to set the object before us in more lively colours. But still the ideas it presents are different to the _feeling_ from those, which arise from the memory and the judgment. There is something weak and imperfect amidst all that seeming vehemence of thought and sentiment, which attends the fictions of poetry. //¬*We* shall afterwards have occasion to remark both the resemblances and differences betwixt a poetical enthusiasm, and a serious conviction. In the mean time I cannot forbear observing, that the great difference in their feeling proceeds in some measure from reflection and _general rules_. We observe, that the vigour of conception, which fictions receive from poetry and eloquence, is a circumstance merely accidental, of which every idea is equally susceptible; and that such fictions are connected with nothing that is real. This observation makes us only lend ourselves, so to speak, to the <SBN#632>fiction: But causes the idea to feel very different from the eternal establish’d persuasions founded on memory and custom. They are somewhat of the same kind: But the one is much inferior to the other, both in its causes and effects. //¬*A like* reflection on _general rules_ keeps us from augmenting our belief upon every encrease of the force and vivacity of our ideas. Where an opinion admits of no doubt, or opposite probability, we attribute to it a full conviction; tho’ the want of resemblance, or contiguity, may render its force inferior to that of other opinions. ’Tis thus the understanding corrects the appearances of the senses, and makes us imagine, that an object at twenty foot distance seems even to the eye as large as one of the same dimensions at ten.//</app>"

[+[T 1.3.14.11] @added for ease of reference]_ after these words _(any idea of power.)_ beginning a new paragraph._</description>*Some* have asserted, that we feel an energy, or power, in our own mind; and that having in this manner acquir’d the idea of power, we transfer that quality to matter, where we are not able immediately to discover it. The motions of our body, and the thoughts and sentiments of our mind, (say they) obey the will; nor do we seek any farther to acquire a just notion of force or power. But to convince us how fallacious this reasoning is, we need only consider, that the will being here consider’d as a cause, has no more a discoverable connexion with its effects, than any material cause has with its proper effect. So far from perceiving the connexion betwixt an act of volition, and a motion of the body; ’tis allow’d that no effect is more inexplicable from the powers and essence of thought and matter. Nor is the empire of the will over our mind more intelligible. The effect is there distinguishable and separable from the cause, and cou’d not be foreseen without the experience of their constant conjunction. We have command over our mind to a certain degree, but beyond _that_ lose all empire over it: And ’tis <SBN#633>evidently impossible to fix any precise bounds to our authority, where we consult not experience. In short, the actions of the mind are, in this respect, the same with those of matter. We perceive only their constant conjunction; nor can we ever reason beyond it. No internal impression has an apparent energy, more than external objects have. Since, therefore, matter is confess’d by philosophers to operate by an unknown force, we shou’d in vain hope to attain an idea of force by consulting our own minds[30a,a].//<hr/></app>"

If perceptions are distinct existences, they form a whole only by being connected together. But no connexions among distinct existences are ever discoverable by human understanding. We only _feel_ a connexion or determination of the thought, to pass from one object to another. It follows, therefore, that the thought alone finds personal identity, when reflecting on the train of past perceptions, that compose a mind, the ideas of them are felt to be connected together, and naturally introduce each other. However extraordinary this conclusion may seem, it need not surprize us. Most philosophers seem inclin’d to think, that personal identity _arises_ from consciousness; and consciousness is nothing but a reflected thought or perception. The present philosophy, therefore, has so far a promising aspect.

[+[1.2.5.26] @added for ease of reference]_ to these words _(impressions and ideas.)</description>*As* long as we confine our speculations to _the appearances_ of objects to our senses, without entering into disquisitions concerning their real nature and operations, we are safe from all difficulties, and can never be embarrass’d by any question. Thus, if it be ask’d, whether the invisible and intangible distance, interpos’d betwixt two objects, be something or nothing: ’Tis easy to answer, that it is _something_, viz. a property of the objects, which affect the _senses_ after such a particular manner. If it be ask’d, whether two objects, having such a distance betwixt them, touch or not: It may be answer’d, that this depends upon the definition of the word, _touch_. If objects be said to touch, when there is nothing _sensible_ interpos’d betwixt them, these objects touch: If objects be said to touch, when their _images_ strike contiguous parts of the eye, <SBN#639>and when the hand _feels_ both objects successively, without any interpos’d motion, these objects do not touch. The appearances of objects to our senses are all consistent; and no difficulties can ever arise, but from the obscurity of the terms we make use of. //¬*If* we carry our enquiry beyond the appearances of objects to the senses, I am afraid, that most of our conclusions will be full of scepticism and uncertainty. Thus if it be ask’d, whether or not the invisible and intangible distance be always full of _body_, or of something that by an improvement of our organs might become visible or tangible, I must acknowledge, that I find no very decisive arguments on either side; tho’ I am inclin’d to the contrary opinion, as being more suitable to vulgar and popular notions. If _the Newtonian_ philosophy be rightly understood it will be found to mean no more. A vacuum is asserted: That is, bodies are said to be plac’d after such a manner, as to receive bodies betwixt them, without impulsion or penetration. The real nature of this position of bodies is unknown. We are only acquainted with its effects on the senses, and its power of receiving body. Nothing is more suitable to that philosophy, than a modest scepticism to a certain degree, and a fair confession of ignorance in subjects, that exceed all human capacity.</app>"

    text: "One might think it were entirely superfluous to prove this, if a late author, who has had the good fortune to obtain some reputation, had not seriously affirmed, that such a falshood is the foundation of all guilt and moral deformity. That we may discover the fallacy of his hypothesis, we need only consider, that a false conclusion is drawn from an action, only by means of an obscurity of natural principles, which makes a cause be secretly interrupted in its operation, by contrary causes, and renders the connection betwixt two objects uncertain and variable. Now, as a like uncertainty and variety of causes take place, even in natural objects, and produce a like error in our judgment, if that tendency to produce error were the very essence of vice and immorality, it shou’d follow, that even inanimate objects might be vicious and immoral. //¬’Tis in vain to urge, that inanimate objects act without liberty and choice. For as liberty and choice are not necessary to make an action produce in us an erroneous conclusion, they can be, in no respect, essential to morality; and I do not readily perceive, upon this system, how they can ever come to be regarded by it. If the tendency to cause error be the origin of immorality, that tendency and immorality wou’d in every case be inseparable. //¬Add to this, that if I had used the precaution of shutting the windows, while I indulg’d myself in those liberties with my neighbour’s wife, I should have been guilty of no immorality; and that because my action, being perfectly conceal’d, wou’d have had no tendency to produce any false conclusion. <SBN#462>//¬For the same reason, a thief, who steals in by a ladder at a window, and takes all imaginable care to cause no disturbance, is in no respect criminal. For either he will not be perceiv’d, or if he be, ’tis impossible he can produce any error, nor will any one, from these circumstances, take him to be other than what he really is. //¬’Tis well known, that those who are squint-sighted, do very readily cause mistakes in others, and that we imagine they salute or are talking to one person, while they address themselves to another. Are they therefore, upon that account, immoral? //¬Besides, we may easily observe, that in all those arguments there is an evident reasoning in a circle. A person who takes possession of _another_’s goods, and uses them as his _own_, in a manner declares them to be his own; and this falshood is the source of the immorality of injustice. But is property, or right, or obligation, intelligible, without an antecedent morality? //¬A man that is ungrateful to his benefactor, in a manner affirms, that he never received any favours from him. But in what manner? Is it because ’tis his duty to be grateful? But this supposes, that there is some antecedent rule of duty and morals. Is it because human nature is generally grateful, and makes us conclude, that a man who does any harm never received any favour from the person he harm’d? But human nature is not so generally grateful, as to justify such a conclusion. Or if it were, is an exception to a general rule in every case criminal, for no other reason than because it is an exception? //¬But what may suffice entirely to destroy this whimsical system is, that it leaves us under the same difficulty to give a reason why truth is virtuous and falshood vicious, as to account for the merit or turpitude of any other action. I shall allow, if you please, that all immorality is derived from this supposed falsehood in action, provided you can give me any plausible reason, why such a falshood is immoral. If you consider rightly of the matter, you will find yourself in the same difficulty as at the beginning. //¬This last argument is very conclusive; because, if there be not an evident merit or turpitude annex’d to this species of truth or falshood, it can never have any influence upon our actions. For, who ever thought of forbearing any action, because others might possibly draw false conclusions from it? Or, who ever perform’d any, that he might give rise to true conclusions?"

    text: "As a proof, how confus’d our way of thinking on this subject commonly is, we may observe, that those who assert, that morality is demonstrable, do not say, that morality lies in the relations, and that the relations are distinguishable by reason. They only say, that reason can discover such an action, in such relations, to be virtuous, and such another vicious. It seems they thought it sufficient, if they cou’d bring the word, Relation, into the proposition, without troubling themselves whether it was to the purpose or not. But here, I think, is plain argument. Demonstrative reason discovers only relations. But that reason, according to this hypothesis, discovers also vice and virtue. These moral qualities, therefore, must be relations. When we blame any action, in any situation, the whole complicated object, of action and situation, must form certain relations, wherein the essence of vice consists. This hypothesis is not otherwise intelligible. For what does reason discover, when it pronounces any action vicious? Does it discover a relation or a matter of fact? These questions are decisive, and must not be eluded."

    text: "No questions in philosophy are more difficult, than when a number of causes present themselves for the same phænomenon, to determine which is the principal and predominant. There seldom is any very precise argument to fix our choice, and men must be contented to be guided by a kind of taste or fancy, arising from analogy, and a comparison of similar instances. Thus, in the present case, there are, no doubt, motives of public interest for most of the rules, which determine property; but still I suspect, that these rules are principally fix’d by the imagination, or the more frivolous properties of our thought and conception. I shall continue to explain these causes, leaving it to the reader’s choice, whether he will prefer those deriv’d from publick utility, or those deriv’d from the imagination. We shall begin with the right of the present possessor. //¬’Tis a quality, which (_a_) I have already observ’d in human nature, that when two objects appear in a close relation to each other, the mind is apt to ascribe to them any additional relation, in order to compleat the union; and this inclination is so strong, as often to make us run into errors (such as that of the conjunction of thought and matter) if we find that they can serve to that purpose. Many of our impressions are incapable of place or local position; and yet those very impressions we suppose to have a local conjunction with the impressions of sight and touch, merely because they are conjoin’d by causation, and are already united in the imagination. Since, therefore, we can feign a new relation, and even an absurd one, in order to compleat any union, ’twill easily be imagin’d, that if there be any relations, which depend on the mind, ’twill readily conjoin them to any preceding relation, and unite, by a new bond, such objects as have already an union in the fancy. Thus for instance, we never fail, in our arrangement of bodies, to place those which are _resembling_ in _contiguity_ to each other, or at least in _correspondent_ points of view; because we feel a satisfaction in joining the relation of contiguity to that of resemblance, or the resemblance of situation to that of qualities. And this is easily accounted for from the known properties of human nature. When the mind is determin’d to join certain objects, but undetermin’d in its choice of the particular objects, it naturally turns its eye to such as are related together. They are already united in the mind: They present themselves at the same time to the conception; and instead of requiring any new reason for their conjunction, it wou’d require a very powerful reason to make us over-look this natural affinity. This we shall have occasion to explain more fully afterwards, when we come to treat of _beauty_. In the mean time, we may content ourselves with observing, that the same love of order and uniformity, which arranges the books in a library, and the chairs in a parlour, contributes to the formation of society, and to the well-being of mankind, by modifying the general rule concerning the stability of possession. [-And as +As @originally 'And as'; manuscript deletion] property forms a relation betwixt a person and an object, ’tis natural to found it on some preceding relation; and as property is nothing but a constant possession, secur’d by the laws <SBN#505>of society, ’tis natural to add it to the present possession, which is a relation that resembles it. For this also has its influence. If it be natural to conjoin all sorts of relations, ’tis more so, to conjoin such relations as are resembling, and are related together."

    text: "If we seek a solution of these difficulties in reason and public interest, we never shall find satisfaction; and if we look for it in the imagination, ’tis evident, that the qualities, which operate upon that faculty, run so insensibly and gradually into each other, that ’tis impossible to give them any precise bounds or termination. The difficulties on this head must encrease, when we consider, that our judgment alters very sensibly, according to the subject, and that the same power and proximity will be deem’d possession in one case, which is not esteem’d such in another. A person, who has hunted a hare to the last degree of weariness, wou’d look upon it as an injustice for another to rush in before him, and seize his prey. But the same person, advancing to pluck an apple, that hangs within his reach, has no reason to complain, if another, more alert, passes <SBN#507>him, and takes possession. What is the reason of this difference, but that immobility, not being natural to the hare, but the effect of industry, forms in that case a strong relation with the hunter, which is wanting in the other? //¬Here then it appears, that a certain and infallible power of enjoyment, without touch or some other sensible relation, often produces not property: And I farther observe, that a sensible relation, without any present power, is sometimes sufficient to give a title to any object. The sight of a thing is seldom a considerable relation, and is only regarded as such, when the object is hidden, or very obscure; in which case we find, that the view alone conveys a property; according to that maxim, _that even a whole continent belongs to the nation, which first discover’d it_. ’Tis however remarkable, that both in the case of discovery and that of possession, the first discoverer and possessor must join to the relation an intention of rendering himself proprietor, otherwise the relation will not have its effect; and that because the connexion in our fancy betwixt the property and the relation is not so great, but that it requires to be help’d by such an intention. //¬From all these circumstances, ’tis easy to see how perplex’d many questions may become concerning the acquisition of property by occupation; and the least effort of thought may present us with instances, which are not susceptible of any reasonable decision. If we prefer examples, which are real, to such as are feign’d, we may consider the following one, which is to be met with in almost every writer, that has treated of the laws of nature. [-  +//¬ @the paragraph break here is a manuscript alteration]Two _Grecian_ colonies, leaving their native country, in search of new seats, were inform’d that a city near them was deserted by its inhabitants. To know the truth of this report, they dispatch’d at once <SBN#508>two messengers, one from each colony; who finding on their approach, that their information was true, begun a race together with an intention to take possession of the city, each of them for his countrymen. One of these messengers, finding that he was not an equal match for the other, launch’d his spear at the gates of the city, and was so fortunate as to fix it there before the arrival of his companion. This produc’d a dispute betwixt the two colonies, which of them was the proprietor of the empty city; and this dispute still subsists among philosophers. For my part I find the dispute impossible to be decided, and that because the whole question hangs upon the fancy, which in this case is not possess’d of any precise or determinate standard, upon which it can give sentence. [-  +//¬ @the paragraph break here is a manuscript alteration]To make this evident, let us consider, that if these two persons had been simply members of the colonies, and not messengers or deputies, their actions wou’d not have been of any consequence; since in that case their relation to the colonies wou’d have been but feeble and imperfect. Add to this, that nothing determin’d them to run to the gates rather than the walls, or any other part of the city, but that the gates, being the most obvious and remarkable part, satisfy the fancy best in taking them for the whole; as we find by the poets, who frequently draw their images and metaphors from them. Besides we may consider, that the touch or contact of the one messenger is not properly possession, no more than the piercing the gates with a spear; but only forms a relation; and there is a relation, in the other case, equally obvious, tho’ not, perhaps, of equal force. Which of these relations, then, conveys a right and property, or whether any of them be sufficient for that effect, I leave to the decision of such as are wiser than myself."

    text: "This source of property can never be explain’d but from the imaginations; and one may affirm, that the causes are here unmix’d. We shall proceed to explain them more particularly, and illustrate them by examples from common life and experience. //¬It has been observ’d above, that the mind has a natural propensity to join relations, especially resembling ones, and finds a kind of fitness and uniformity in such an union. From this propensity are deriv’d these laws of nature, _that upon the first formation of society, property always follows the present possession_; and afterwards, _that it arises from first or from long possession_. Now we may easily observe, that relation is not confin’d merely to one degree; but that from an object, that is related to us, we acquire a relation to every other object, which is related to it, and so on, till the thought loses the chain by too long a progress. However the relation may weaken by each remove, ’tis not immediately destroy’d; but frequently connects two objects by means of an intermediate one, which is related to both. And this principle is of such force as to give rise to the right of _accession_, and causes us to acquire the property not only of such objects as we are immediately possess’d of, but also of such as are closely connected with them. //¬Suppose a _German_, a _Frenchman_, and a _Spaniard_ to come into a room where there are plac’d upon the table three bottles of wine, <SBN#510>_Rhenish_, _Burgundy_ and _Port_; and suppose they shou’d fall a quarrelling about the division of them; a person, who was chosen for umpire, wou’d naturally, to shew his impartiality, give every one the product of his own country: And this from a principle, which, in some measure, is the source of those laws of nature, that ascribe property to occupation, prescription and accession. //¬In all these cases, and particularly that of accession, there is first a _natural_ union betwixt the idea of the person and that of the object, and afterwards a new and  _moral_ union produc’d by that right or property, which we ascribe to the person. But here there occurs a difficulty, which merits our attention, and may afford us an opportunity of putting to tryal that singular method of reasoning, which has been employ’d on the present subject. I have already observ’d, that the imagination passes with greater facility from little to great, than from great to little, and that the transition of ideas is always easier and smoother in the former case than in the latter. Now as the right of accession arises from the easy transition of ideas, by which related objects are connected together, it shou’d naturally be imagin’d, that the right of accession must encrease in strength, in proportion as the transition of ideas is perform’d with greater facility. It may, therefore, be thought, that when we have acquir’d the property of any small object, we shall readily consider any great object related to it as an accession, and as belonging to the proprietor of the small one; since the transition is in that case very easy from the small object to the great one, and shou’d connect them together in the closest manner. But in fact the case is always found to be otherwise. The empire of _Great Britain_ seems to draw along with it the dominion of the _Orkneys_, the  _Hebrides_, the isle of _Man_, and the isle of _Wight_; but the authority over those lesser islands does not naturally imply any title to  _Great Britain_. In short, a small object naturally follows a great one as its accession; but a great one is never suppos’d to belong to the proprietor of a small one related to it, merely on account of that property and relation. Yet in this latter case the transition of ideas is smoother from the proprietor to the small object, which is his property, and from the small object to the great one, than in the former case from the proprietor to the great object, and from the great one to the small. It may therefore be thought, that these phænomena are objections to the foregoing hypothesis, _that the ascribing of property to accession is nothing but an [-affect +effect @originally 'affect'; clearly an error] of the relations of ideas, and of the smooth transition of the imagination_. //¬’Twill be easy to solve this objection, if we consider the agility and unsteadiness of the imagination, with the different views, in which it is continually placing its objects. When we attribute to a person a property in two objects, we do not always pass from the person to one object, and from that to the other related to it. The objects being here to be consider’d as the property of the person, we are apt to join them <SBN#511>together, and place them in the same light. Suppose, therefore, a great and a small object to be related together; if a person be strongly related to the great object, he will likewise be strongly related to both the objects, consider’d together, because be is related to the most considerable part. On the contrary, if he be only related to the small object, he will not be strongly related to both, consider’d together, since his relation lies only with the most trivial part, which is not apt to strike us in any great degree, when we consider the whole. And this is the reason, why small objects become accessions to great ones, and not great to small. //¬’Tis the general opinion of philosophers and civilians, that the sea is incapable of becoming the property of any nation; and that because ’tis impossible to take possession of it, or form any such distinct relation with it, as may be the foundation of property. Where this reason ceases, property immediately takes place. Thus the most strenuous advocates for the liberty of the seas universally allow, that friths and bays naturally belong as an accession to the proprietors of the surrounding continent. These have properly no more bond or union with the land, than the _pacific_ ocean wou’d have; but having an union in the fancy, and being at the same time _inferior_, they are of course regarded as an accession. //¬The property of rivers, by the laws of most nations, and by the natural turn of our thought, is attributed to the proprietors of their banks, excepting such vast rivers as the _Rhine_ or the _Danube_, which seem too large to the imagination to follow as an accession the property of the neighbouring fields. Yet even these rivers are consider’d as the property of that nation, thro’ whose dominions they run; the idea of a nation being of a suitable bulk to correspond with them, and bear them such a relation in the fancy. //¬The accessions, which are made to lands bordering upon rivers, follow the land, say the civilians, provided [-it +they @originally 'it'; manuscript alteration] be made by what they call _alluvion_, that is, insensibly and imperceptibly; which are circumstances that mightily assist the imagination in the conjunction. Where there is any considerable portion torn at once from one bank, and join’d to another, it becomes not his property, whose land it falls on, till it unite with the land, and till the trees or plants have spread their roots into both. Before that, the imagination does not sufficiently join them. //¬There are other cases, which somewhat resemble this of accession, but which, at the bottom, are considerably different, and merit our attention. Of this kind is the conjunction of the properties of different persons, after such a manner as not to admit of _separation_. The question is, to whom the united mass must belong. //¬Where this conjunction is of such a nature as to admit of _division_, but not of _separation_, the decision is natural and easy. The whole mass must be suppos’d to be common betwixt the proprietors of the <SBN#512>several parts, and afterwards must be divided according to the proportions of these parts. But here I cannot forbear taking notice of a remarkable subtilty of the _Roman_ law, in distinguishing betwixt _confusion_ and _commixtion_. Confusion is an union of two bodies, such as different liquors, where the parts become entirely undistinguishable. Commixtion is the blending of two bodies, such as two bushels of corn, where the parts remain separate in an obvious and visible manner. As in the latter case the imagination discovers not so entire an union as in the former, but is able to trace and preserve a distinct idea of the property of each; this is the reason, why the _civil_ law, tho’ it establish’d an entire community in the case of _confusion_, and after that a proportional division, yet in the case of _commixtion_, supposes each of the proprietors to maintain a distinct right; however necessity may at last force them to submit to the same division. //¬_Quod si frumentum Titii frumento tuo mistum fuerit: siquidem ex voluntate vestra, commune est: quia singula corpora, id est, singula grana, quæ cujusque propria fuerunt, ex consensu vestro communicata sunt. Quod si casu id mistum fuerit, vel Titius id miscuerit sine tua voluntate, non videtur id commune esse; quia singula corpora in sua substantia durant. Sed nec magis istis casibus commune sit frumentum quam grex intelligitur esse communis, si pecora Titii tuis pecoribus mista fuerint. Sed si ab alterutro vestrûm totum id frumentum retineatur, in rem quidem actio pro modo frumenti cujusque competit. Arbitrio autem judicis, ut ipse æstimet quale cujusque frumentum fuerit._ Inst. Lib. II. Tit. 1. §. 28. //¬Where the properties of two persons are united after such a manner as neither to admit of _division_ nor _separation_, as when one builds a house on another’s ground, in that case, the whole must belong to one of the proprietors: And here I assert, that it naturally is conceiv’d to belong to the proprietor of the most considerable part. For however the compound object may have a relation to two different persons, and carry our view at once to both of them, yet as the most considerable part principally engages our attention, and by the strict union draws the inferior along it; for this reason, the whole bears a relation to the proprietor of that part, and is regarded as his property. The only difficulty is, what we shall be pleas’d to call the most considerable part, and most attractive to the imagination. //¬This quality depends on several different circumstances, which have little connexion with each other. One part of a compound object may become more considerable than another, either because it is more constant and durable; because it is of greater value; because it is more obvious and remarkable; because it is of greater extent; or because its existence is more separate and independent. ’Twill be easy to conceive, that, as these circumstances may be conjoin’d and oppos’d in all the different ways, and according to all the different degrees, which can be <SBN#513>imagin’d, there will result many cases, where the reasons on both sides are so equally ballanc’d, that ’tis impossible for us to give any satisfactory decision. Here then is the proper business of municipal laws, to fix what the principles of human nature have left undetermin’d. //¬The superficies yields to the soil, says the civil law: The writing to the paper: The canvas to the picture. These decisions do not well agree together, and are a proof of the contrariety of those principles, from which they are deriv’d. //¬But of all the questions of this kind the most curious is that, which for so many ages divided the disciples of _Proculus_ and _Sabinus_. Suppose a person shou’d make a cup from the metal of another, or a ship from his wood, and suppose the proprietor of the metal or wood shou’d demand his goods, the question is, whether he acquires a title to the cup or ship. _Sabinus_ maintain’d the affirmative, and asserted that the substance or matter is the foundation of all the qualities; that it is incorruptible and immortal, and therefore superior to the form, which is casual and dependent. On the other hand, _Proculus_ observ’d, that the form is the most obvious and remarkable part, and that from it bodies are denominated of this or that particular species. To which he might have added, that the matter or substance is in most bodies so fluctuating and uncertain, that ’tis utterly impossible to trace it in all its changes. For my part, I know not from what principles such a controversy can be certainly determin’d. I shall therefore content my self with observing, that the decision of _Trebonian_ seems to me pretty ingenious; that the cup belongs to the proprietor of the metal, because it can be brought back to its first form: But that the ship belongs to the author of its form for a contrary reason. But however ingenious this reason may seem, it plainly depends upon the fancy, which by the possibility of such a reduction, finds a closer connexion and relation betwixt a cup and the proprietor of its metal, than betwixt a ship and the proprietor of its wood, where the substance is more fix’d and unalterable."

Mean while I shall rest contented with observing one example, which belongs to the present subject. Suppose that a person die without children, and that a dispute arises among his relations concerning his inheritance; ’tis evident, that if his riches be deriv’d partly from his father, partly from his mother, the most natural way of determining such a dispute, is, to divide his possessions, and assign each part to the family, from whence it is deriv’d.

    text: "This proposition must hold strictly true, with regard to every quality, that is determin’d merely by sentiment. In what sense we can talk either of a _right_ or a _wrong_ taste in morals, eloquence, or beauty, shall be consider’d afterwards. In the mean time, it may be observ’d, that there is such an uniformity in the _general_ sentiments of mankind, as to render such questions of but small importance."

    text: "It is not here asserted, that _present possession_ or _conquest_ are sufficient to give a title against _long possession_ and _positive laws:_ But only that they have some force, and will be able to cast the ballance where the titles are otherwise equal, and will even be sufficient _sometimes_ to sanctify the weaker title. What degree of force they have is difficult to determine. I believe all moderate men will allow, that they have great force in all disputes concerning the rights of princes."

    text: "Love and esteem are at the bottom the same passions, and arise from like causes. The qualities, that produce both, are agreeable, and give pleasure. But where this pleasure is severe and serious; or where its object is great, and makes a strong impression; or where it produces any degree of humility and awe: In all these cases, the passion, which arises from the pleasure, is more properly denominated esteem than love. Benevolence attends both: But is connected with love in a more eminent degree."

The order of the universe proves an omnipotent mind; that is, a mind whose will is _constantly attended_ with the obedience of every creature and being. Nothing more is requisite to give a foundation to all the articles of religion, nor is it necessary we shou’d form a distinct idea of the force and energy of the supreme Being."
