    text: "^T^HERE is very little ground, either from reason or observation, to conclude the world eternal or incorruptible. The continual and rapid motion of matter, the violent revolutions with which every part is agitated, the changes remarked in the heavens, the plain traces as well as tradition of an universal deluge, or general convulsion of the elements; all these prove strongly the mortality of this fabric of the world, and its passage, by corruption or dissolution, from one state or order to another. It must therefore, as well as each individual form which it contains, have its infancy, youth, manhood, and old age; and it is probable, that, in all these variations, man, equally with every animal and vegetable, will partake. In the flourishing age of the world, it may be expected, that the |human species should possess greater vigour both of mind and body, more prosperous health, higher spirits, longer life, and a stronger inclination and power of generation. But if the general system of things, and human society of course, have any such gradual revolutions, they are too slow to be discernible in that short period which is comprehended by history and tradition. Stature and force of body, length of life, even courage and extent of genius, seem hitherto to have been naturally, in all ages, pretty much the same. The arts and sciences, indeed, have flourished in one period, and have decayed in another: But we may observe, that, at the time when they rose to greatest perfection among one people, they were perhaps totally unknown to all the neighbouring nations; and though they universally decayed in one age, yet in a succeeding generation they again revived, and diffused themselves over the world. As far, therefore, as observation reaches, there is no universal difference discernible in the human species; and though it were allowed, that the universe, like an animal body, had a natural progress from infancy to old age; yet as it must still be uncertain, whether, at present, it be advancing to its point of perfection, or declining from it, we cannot thence presuppose any decay in human nature[1,*]. To prove, therefore, or account for that superior populousness of antiquity, which is commonly supposed, by the imaginary youth or vigour of the world, will scarcely be admitted by any just reasoner. These _general physical_ causes ought entirely to be excluded from this question."

    text: "There are indeed some more _particular physical_ causes of importance. Diseases are mentioned in antiquity, which are almost unknown to modern medicine; and new diseases have arisen and propagated themselves, of which there are no traces in ancient history. In this particular we may observe, upon comparison, that the disadvantage is much on the side of the moderns. Not to mention some others of less moment; the small-pox [-commit +commits @originally 'commit'; 'commits' in earlier editions, which is clearly what was intended] such ravages, as would almost alone account for the great superiority ascribed to ancient times. The tenth or the twelfth part of mankind, destroyed every gener|ation, should make a vast difference, it may be thought, in the numbers of the people; and when joined to venereal distempers, a new plague diffused every where, this disease is perhaps equivalent, by its constant operation, to the three great scourges of mankind, war, pestilence, and famine. Were it certain, therefore, that ancient times were more populous than the present, and could no moral causes be assigned for so great a change; these physical causes alone, in the opinion of many, would be sufficient to give us satisfaction on that head."

    text: "But is it certain, that antiquity was so much more populous, as is pretended? The extravagancies of *Vossius*, with regard to this subject, are well known. But an author of much greater genius and discernment has ventured to affirm, that, according to the best computations which these subjects will admit of, there are not now, on the face of the earth, the fiftieth part of mankind, which existed in the time of *Julius Cæsar*[2,†]. It may easily be observed, that the comparison, in this case, must be imperfect, even though we confine our|selves to the scene of ancient history; *Europe*, and the nations round the *Mediterranean*. We know not exactly the numbers of any *European* kingdom, or even city, at present: How can we pretend to calculate those of ancient cities and states, where historians have left us such imperfect traces? For my part, the matter appears to me so uncertain, that, as I intend to throw together some reflections on that head, I shall intermingle the enquiry concerning _causes_ with that concerning _facts;_ which ought never to be admitted, where the facts can be ascertained with any tolerable assurance. We shall, _first_, consider whether it be probable, from what we know of the situation of society in both periods, that antiquity must have been more populous; _secondly_, whether in reality it was so. If I can make it appear, that the conclusion is not so certain as is pretended, in favour of antiquity, it is all I aspire to."

    text: "In general, we may observe, that the question, with regard to the comparative populousness of ages or kingdoms, implies important consequences, and commonly determines concerning the preference of their whole police, their manners, and the constitution of their government. For as there is in all men, both male and female, a desire and power of generation, more active than is ever universally exerted, the restraints, which they lie under, must proceed from some difficulties in their situation, which it belongs to a wise legislature carefully to observe and remove. Almost every man who thinks he can maintain a family will have one; and the human species, at this rate of propagation, would more than double every generation. How fast do mankind multiply in every colony or new settlement; where it is an easy matter to provide for a family; and where men are nowise straitened or confined, as in long established governments? History tells us frequently of plagues, which have swept away the third or fourth part of a people: Yet in a generation or two, the destruction was not perceived; and the society had again acquired their former number. The lands which were cultivated, the houses built, the commodities raised, the riches acquired, enabled the people, who escaped, immediately to marry, and to rear families, |which supplied the place of those who had perished[3,†]. And for a like reason, every wise, just, and mild government, by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure, will always abound most in people, as well as in commodities and riches. A country, indeed, whose climate and soil are fitted for vines, will naturally be more populous than one which produces corn only, and that more populous than one which is only fitted for pasturage. In general, warm climates, as the necessities of the inhabitants are there fewer, and vegetation more powerful, are likely to be most populous: But if every thing else be equal, it seems natural to expect, that, wherever there are most happiness and virtue, and the wisest institutions, there will also be most people."

    text: "The chief difference between the _domestic_ œconomy of the ancients and that of the moderns consists in the practice of slavery, which prevailed among the former, and which has been abolished for some centuries throughout the greater part of *Europe*. Some passionate admirers of the ancients, and zealous partizans of civil liberty, (for these sentiments, as they are, both of them, in the main, extremely just, are found to be almost inseparable) cannot forbear regretting the loss of this institution; and whilst they brand all submission to the government of a single person with the harsh denomination of slavery, they would gladly reduce the greater part of mankind to real slavery and subjection. But to one who considers coolly on the subject it will appear, that human nature, in general, really enjoys more liberty at present, in the most arbitrary government of *Europe*, than it ever did during the most flourishing period of ancient times. As much as submission to a petty prince, whose dominions extend not beyond a single city, is more grievous than obedience to a great monarch; so much is domestic slavery more cruel and oppressive than any civil subjection whatsoever. The more the master is removed from us in place and rank, the greater liberty we enjoy; the less are our actions inspected and controled; and the fainter that cruel comparison becomes between our own subjection, and the freedom, and even dominion of another. The remains which are found of domestic slavery, in the *American* colonies, and among some *European* nations, would never surely create a desire of rendering it more universal. The little humanity, commonly observed in persons, accustomed, from their infancy, to exercise so great authority over their fellow-creatures, and to trample upon human nature, were sufficient |alone to disgust us with that unbounded dominion. Nor can a more probable reason be assigned for the severe, I might say, barbarous manners of ancient times, than the practice of domestic slavery; by which every man of rank was rendered a petty tyrant, and educated amidst the flattery, submission, and low debasement of his slaves."

In modern times, a bad servant finds not easily a good master, nor a bad master a good servant; and the checks are mutual, suitably to the inviolable and eternal laws of reason and equity."

    text: "The custom of exposing old, useless, or sick slaves in an island of the *Tyber*, there to starve, seems to have been pretty common in *Rome*; and whoever recovered, after having been so exposed, had his liberty given him, by an edict of the emperor *Claudius*; in which it was likewise forbidden to kill any slave merely for old age or sickness[4,*]. But supposing that this edict was strictly obeyed, would it better the domestic treatment of slaves, or render their lives much more comfortable? We may imagine what others would practise, when it was the professed maxim of the elder *Cato*, to sell his superannuated slaves for any price, rather than maintain what he esteemed a useless burden[5,†]."

Among other circumstances, |such as displacing the meals and times of bathing, he mentions, that, regularly about the third hour of the night, the neighbours of one, who indulges this false refinement, hear the noise of whips and lashes; and, upon enquiry, find that he is then taking an account of the conduct of his servants, and giving them due correction and discipline. This is not remarked as an instance of cruelty, but only of disorder, which, even in actions the most usual and methodical, changes the fixed hours that an established custom had assigned for them[12,‡]."

    text: "But our present business is only to consider the influence of slavery on the populousness of a state. It is pretended, that, in this particular, the ancient practice had infinitely the advantage, and was the chief cause of that extreme populousness, which is supposed in those times. At present, all masters discourage the marrying of their male servants, and admit not by any means the marriage of the female, who are then supposed altogether incapacitated for their service. But where the property of the servants is lodged in the master, their marriage forms his riches, and brings him a succession of slaves that supply the place of those whom age and infirmity have disabled. He encourages, therefore, their propagation as much as that of his cattle; rears the young with the same care; and |educates them to some art or calling, which may render them more useful or valuable to him. The opulent are, by this policy, interested in the being at least, though not in the well-being of the poor; and enrich themselves, by encreasing the number and industry of those who are subjected to them. Each man, being a sovereign in his own family, has the same interest with regard to it, as the prince with regard to the state; and has not, like the prince, any opposite motives of ambition or vain-glory, which may lead him to depopulate his little sovereignty. All of it is, at all times, under his eye; and he has leisure to inspect the most minute detail of the marriage and education of his subjects[13,*]."

    text: "Such are the consequences of domestic slavery, according to the first aspect and appearance of things: But if we enter more deeply into the subject, we shall perhaps find reason to retract our hasty determinations. The comparison is shocking between the management of human creatures and that of cattle; but being extremely just, when applied to the present subject, it may be proper to trace the consequences of it. At the capital, near all great cities, in all populous, rich, industrious provinces, few cattle are bred. Provisions, lodging, attendance, labour are there dear; and men find their account better in buying the cattle, after they come to a certain age, from the remoter and cheaper countries. These are consequently the only breeding countries for cattle; and by a parity of reason, for men too, when the latter are put on the same footing with the former. To rear a child in *London*, till he could be serviceable, would cost much dearer, than to buy one of the same age from *Scotland* or *Ireland*; where he had been bred in a cottage, covered with rags, and fed on oatmeal or potatoes. Those who had slaves, therefore, in all the richer and |more populous countries, would discourage the pregnancy of the females, and either prevent or destroy the birth. The human species would perish in those places where it ought to encrease the fastest; and a perpetual recruit be wanted from the poorer and more desert provinces. Such a continued drain would tend mightily to depopulate the state, and render great cities ten times more destructive than with us; where every man is master of himself, and provides for his children from the powerful instinct of nature, not the calculations of sordid interest. If *London*, at present, without much encreasing, needs a yearly recruit from the country, of 5000 people, as is usually computed, what must it require, if the greater part of the tradesmen and common people were slaves, and were hindered from breeding by their avaricious masters?"

Where then is that extreme fertility of the *Roman* slaves, which is commonly supposed? So far from multiplying, they could not, it seems, so much as keep up the stock, without immense recruits. And though great numbers were continually manumitted and converted into *Roman* citizens, the numbers even of these did not encrease[16,‡], till the freedom of the city was communicated to foreign provinces."

His orations, on that occasion, still remain, and contain an exact detail of the whole substance left by his father[26,*], in money, merchandise, houses, and slaves, together with the value of each particular. Among the rest were 52 slaves, handicraftsmen, namely, 32 sword-cutlers, and 20 cabinet-makers[27,†]; all males; not a word of any wives, children or family, which they certainly would have had, had it been a common practice at *Athens* to breed from the slaves: And the value of the whole must have much depended on that circumstance. No female slaves are even so much as mentioned, except some house-maids, who belonged to his mother. This argument has great force, if it be not altogether conclusive."

I doubt the advantage is here on the side of antiquity. Perhaps, by an odd connexion of causes, the barbarous practice of the ancients might rather render those times more populous. By removing the terrors of too numerous a family it would engage many people in marriage; and such is the force of natural affection, that very few, in comparison, would have resolution enough, when it came to the push, to carry into execution their former intentions."

Hospitals for foundlings seem favourable to the encrease of numbers; and perhaps, may be so, when kept under proper restrictions. But when they open the door to every one, without distinction, they have probably a contrary effect, and are pernicious to the state. It is computed, that every ninth child born at *Paris*, is sent to the hospital; though it seems certain, according to the common course of human affairs, that it is not a hundredth child whose parents are altogether incapacitated to rear and educate him. The great difference, for health, industry, and morals, between an education in an hospital and that in a private family, should induce us not to make the entrance into the former too easy and engaging. To kill one’s own child is shocking to nature, and must therefore be somewhat unusual; but to turn over the care of him upon others, is very tempting to the natural indolence of mankind."

Enormous cities are, besides, destructive to society, beget vice and disorder of all kinds, starve the remoter provinces, and even starve themselves, by the prices to which they raise all provisions.

In a state where agriculture alone flourishes, there may be many inhabitants; and if these be all armed and disciplined, a great force may be called out upon occasion: But great bodies of mercenary troops can never be maintained, without either great trade and numerous manufactures, or extensive dominions. The United Provinces never were masters of such a force by sea and land, as that which is said to belong to *Dionysius*; yet they possess as large a territory, perfectly well cultivated, and have much more resources from their commerce and industry. *Diodorus Siculus* allows, that, even in his time, the army of *Dionysius* appeared incredible; that is, as I interpret it, was entirely a fiction, and the opinion arose from the exaggerated flattery of the courtiers, and perhaps from the vanity and policy of the tyrant himself."

(3.) The forces, enumerated by the same historian[142,§], being all citizens, and amounting to 13,000 heavy-armed infantry, prove the same method of calculation; as also the whole tenor of the *Greek* historians, who always understand men of full age, when they assign the number of citizens in any republic. Now, these being but the fourth of the inhabitants, the free *Athenians* were by this account 84,000; the strangers 40,000; and the slaves, calculating by the smaller number, and allowing that they married and propagated at the same rate with freemen, were 160,000; and the whole of the inhabitants 284,000: A number surely large enough.

If you will take the pains to estimate an _obolus_ a day, and the slaves at 400,000, computing only at four years purchase, you will find the sum above 12,000 talents; even though allowance be made for the great number of holidays in *Athens*.

For as the *Greek* republics maintained no mercenary forces, and had no militia distinct from the whole body of the citizens, it is not conceivable what other medium there could be of computation. That such an army could ever, by *Greece*, be brought into the field, and be maintained there, is contrary to all history. Upon this supposition, therefore, we may thus reason. The free *Greeks* of all ages and sexes were 860,000. The slaves, estimating them by the number of |*Athenian* slaves as above, who seldom married or had families, were double the male citizens of full age, to wit, 430,000. And all the inhabitants of ancient *Greece*, excepting *Laconia*, were about one million two hundred and ninety thousand: No mighty number, nor exceeding what may be found at present in *Scotland*, a country of not much greater extent, and very indifferently peopled."

The seats of vast monarchies, by introducing extravagant luxury, irregular expence, idleness, dependence, and false ideas of rank and superiority, are improper for commerce. Extensive commerce checks itself, by raising the price of all labour and commodities. When a great court engages the attendance of a numerous nobility, possessed of overgrown fortunes, the middling gentry remain in their provincial towns, where they can make a figure on a moderate income. And if the dominions of a state arrive at an enormous size, there necessarily arise many capitals, in the remoter provinces, whither all the inhabitants, except a few courtiers, repair for education, fortune, and amusement[216,*]. *London*, by uniting extensive commerce and middling empire, has, perhaps, arrived at a greatness, which no city will ever be able to exceed."

The *Tyber* froze in *Rome*, and the ground was covered with snow for forty days. When *Juvenal*[218,*] describes a superstitious woman, he represents her as breaking the ice of the *Tyber*, that she might perform her ablutions: >Hybernum fracta glacie descendet in amnem, //Ter matutino Tyberi mergetur.< He speaks of that river’s freezing as a common event. Many passages of *Horace* suppose the streets of *Rome* full of snow and ice. We should have more certainty with regard to this point, had the ancients known the use of thermometers: But their writers, without intending it, give us information, sufficient to convince us, that the winters are now much more temperate at *Rome* than formerly. At present the *Tyber* no more freezes at *Rome* than the *Nile* at *Cairo*. The *Romans* esteem the winters very rigorous, if the snow lie two days, and if one see for eight and forty hours a few icicles hang from a fountain that has a north exposure.”

The gods, therefore, who affect works of dignity and importance, have suppressed many of their oracles, and deign not to use so many interpreters of their will to so diminutive a people."

You may observe, that *Plutarch* assigns, for a cause of the decay of mankind, not the extensive dominion of the *Romans*, but the former wars and factions of the several states; all which were quieted by the *Roman* arms. *Plutarch*’s reasoning, therefore, is directly contrary to the inference, which is drawn from the fact he advances."

How therefore can we |imagine, that the *Roman* yoke was so burdensome over that part of the world? The oppression of the proconsuls was checked; and the magistracies in *Greece* being all bestowed, in the several cities, by the free votes of the people, there was no necessity for the competitors to attend the emperor’s court. If great numbers went to seek their fortunes in *Rome*, and advance themselves by learning or eloquence, the commodities of their native country, many of them would return with the fortunes which they had acquired, and thereby enrich the *Grecian* commonwealths."

I own, that, if *Plutarch* had this fact in his eye, he is here guilty of a gross paralogism, and assigns causes no wise proportioned to the effects.

Thus an author, who lived at that very period of antiquity which is represented as most populous[265,ǁ], complains of the desolation which then prevailed, gives the preference to former times, and has recourse to ancient fables as a foundation for his opinion. The humour of blaming the present, and admiring the past, is strongly rooted in human nature, and has an influence even on persons endued with the profoundest judgment and most extensive learning."

The inhuman sports exhibited at *Rome*, may justly be considered too as an effect of the people’s contempt for slaves, and was also a great cause of the general inhumanity of their princes and rulers. Who can read the accounts of the amphitheatrical entertainments without horror? Or who is surprised, that the emperors should treat that people in the same way the people treated their inferiors? One’s humanity is apt to renew the barbarous wish of *Caligula*, that the people had but one neck: A man could almost be pleased, by a single blow, to put an end to such a race of monsters. You may thank God, says the author above cited, (_epist._ 7.) addressing himself to the *Roman* people, that you have a master (to wit the mild and merciful *Nero*) who is incapable of learning cruelty from your example. This was spoke in the beginning of his reign: But he fitted them very well afterwards; and, no doubt, was considerably improved by the sight of the barbarous objects, to which he had, from his infancy, been accustomed."

    text: "^A^S _servus_ was the name of the genus, and verna of the species, without any correlative, this forms a strong presumption, that the latter were by far the least numerous. It is an universal observation which we may form upon language, that where two related parts of a whole bear any proportion to each other, in numbers, rank or consideration, there are always correlative terms invented, which answer to both the parts, and express their mutual relation. If they bear no proportion to each other, the term is only invented for the less, and marks its distinction from the whole. Thus _man_ and _woman_, _master_ and _servant_, _father_ and _son_, _prince_ and _subject_, _stranger_ and _citizen_, are correlative terms. But the words _seaman_, _carpenter_, _smith_, _tailor_, &c. have no correspondent terms, which express those who are no seamen, no carpenters, _&c._ Languages differ very much with regard to the particular words where this distinction obtains; and may thence afford very strong inferences, concerning the manners and customs of different nations. The military government of the *Roman* emperors had exalted the soldiery so high, that they balanced all the other orders of the state: Hence _miles_ and _paganus_ became relative terms; a thing, till then, unknown to ancient, and still so to modern languages. Modern superstition exalted the clergy so high, that they overbalanced the whole state: Hence _clergy_ and _laity_ are terms opposed in all modern languages; and in these alone. And from the same principles I infer, that if the number of slaves bought by the *Romans* from foreign countries, had not extremely exceeded those which were bred at home, _verna_ would have had a correlative, which would have expressed the former species of slaves. But these, it would seem, composed the main body of the ancient slaves, and the latter were but a few exceptions."

How much more must this happen in *European* countries, and in or near great cities? I shall add, that, from the experience of our planters, slavery is as little advantageous to the master as to the slave, wherever hired servants can be procured. A man is obliged to cloath and feed his slave; and he does no more for his servant: The price of the first purchase is, therefore, so much loss to him: not to mention, that the fear of punishment will never draw so much labour from a slave, as the dread of being turned off and not getting another service, will from a freeman."

It had even been doubted, whether a woman pregnant was morbid or vitiated; and it is determined, that she is sound, not on account of the value of her offspring, but because it is the natural part or office of women to bear children. “Si mulier prægnans venerit, inter omnes convenit sanam eam esse.

Of *Chians*, 600 citizens banished; lib. xiii. p. 189. At *Ephesus*, 340 killed, 1000 banished; lib. xiii. p. 223. Of *Cyrenians*, 500 nobles killed, all the rest banished; lib. xiv. p. 263. The *Corinthians* killed 120, banished 500; lib. xiv. p. 304. *Phæbidas* the *Spartan* banished 300 *Bæotians*; lib. xv. p. 342. Upon the fall of the *Lacedæmonians*, Democracies were restored in many cities, and severe vengeance taken of the nobles, after the *Greek* manner. But matters did not end there. For the banished nobles, returning in many places, butchered their adversaries at *Phialæ*, in *Corinth*, in *Megara*, in *Phliasia*. In this last place they killed 300 of the people; but these again revolting, killed above 600 of the nobles, and banished the rest; lib. xv. p. 357. In *Arcadia* 1400 banished, besides many killed. The banished retired to *Sparta* and to *Pallantium*: The latter were delivered up to their countrymen, and all killed; lib. xv. p. 373. Of the banished from *Argos* and *Thebes*, there were 509 in the *Spartan* army; _id._ p. 374. Here is a detail of the most remarkable of *Agathocles*’s cruelties from the same author. The people before his usurpation had banished 600 nobles; lib. xix. p. 655. Afterwards that tyrant, in concurrence with the people, killed 4000 nobles, and banished 6000; _id._ p. 647. He killed 4000 people at *Gela*; _id._ p. 741. By *Agathocles*’s brother 8000 banished from *Syracuse*; lib. xx. p. 757. The inhabitants of *Ægesta*, to the number of 40,000, were killed, man, woman, and child; and with tortures, for the sake of their money; _id._ p. 802. All the relations, to wit, father, brother, children, grandfather, of his *Libyan* army, killed; _id._ p. 803. He killed 7000 exiles after capitulation; _id._ p. 816. It is to be remarked, that *Agathocles* was a man of great sense and courage, and is not to be suspected of wanton cruelty, contrary to the maxims of his age."

What will posterity, for instance, infer from this passage of Dr. *Swift*: “I told him, that in the kingdom of *Tribnia* (*Britain*) by the natives called *Langdon* (*London*) where I had sojourned some time in my travels, the bulk of the people consist, in a manner, wholly of discoverers, witnesses, informers, accusers, prosecutors, evidences, swearers, together with their several subservient and subaltern instruments, all under the colours, the conduct, and pay of ministers of state and their deputies. The plots in that kingdom are usually the workmanship of those persons,” _&c._ [-*Gulliver*s +*Gulliver*’s @the apostrophe is missing in the 1777 edition, but present in earlier editions] _travels_. Such a representation might suit the government of *Athens*; not that of *England*, which is remarkable even in modern times, for humanity, justice, and liberty. Yet the Doctor’s satyr, though carried to extremes, as is usual with him, even beyond other satyrical writers, did not altogether want an object. The Bishop of *Rochester*, who was his friend, and of the same party, had been banished a little before by bill of attainder, with great justice, but without such a proof as was legal, or according to the strict forms of common law."

Our speculative factions, especially those of religion, throw such an illusion over our minds, that men seem to regard impartiality to their adversaries and to heretics, as a vice or weakness: But the commonness of books, by means of printing, has obliged modern historians to be more careful in avoiding contradictions and incongruities. *Diodorus Siculus* is a good writer, but it is with pain I see his narration contradict, in so many particulars, the two most authentic pieces of all *Greek* history, to wit, *Xenophon*’s expedition, and *Demosthenes*’s orations. *Plutarch* and *Appian* seem scarce ever to have read *Cicero*’s epistles."

No ancient author ever speaks of the *Pyræum*, *Phalerus*, and *Munychia*, as the same with *Athens*. Much less can it be supposed, that *Dionysius* would consider the matter in that light, after the walls of *Cimon* and *Pericles* were destroyed, and *Athens* was entirely separated from these other towns.

For *Attica* itself was so barren of corn, that it produced not enough even to maintain the peasants. *Tit. Liv.* lib. xliii. cap. 6. And 400,000 medimni would scarcely feed 100,000 men during a twelvemonth. *Lucian*, in his _navigium sive vota_, says, that a ship, which, by the dimensions he gives, seems to have been about the size of our third rates, carried as much corn as would maintain all *Attica* for a twelve-month. But perhaps *Athens* was decayed at that time; and besides, it is not safe to trust to such loose rhetorical calculations."

Whoever is acquainted with the spirit of the *Greeks*, especially of the *Thebans*, will never suspect, that any of them would desert their country, when it was reduced to such extreme peril and distress. As *Alexander* took the town by storm, all those who bore arms were put to the sword without mercy; and they amounted only to 6000 men. Among these were some strangers and manumitted slaves. The captives, consisting of old men, women, children, and slaves, were sold, and they amounted to 30,000. We may therefore conclude that the free citizens in *Thebes*, of both sexes and all ages, were near 24,000; the strangers and slaves about 12,000. These last, we may observe, were somewhat fewer in proportion than at *Athens*; as is reasonable to imagine from this circumstance, that *Athens* was a town of more trade to support slaves, and of more entertainment to allure strangers. It is also to be remarked, that thirty-six thousand was the whole number of people, both in the city of *Thebes*, and the neighbouring territory: A very moderate number, it must be confessed; and this computation, being founded on facts which appear indisputable, must have great weight in the present controversy. The above-mentioned number of *Rhodians* too were all the inhabitants of the island, who were free, and able to bear arms."

See also to the same purpose *Vitruvius*, lib. ii. cap. 8. *Aristides* the sophist, in his oration $εις Ρωμην$, says, that *Rome* consisted of cities on the top of cities; and that if one were to spread it out, and unfold it, it would cover the whole surface of *Italy*. Where an author indulges himself in such extravagant declamations, and gives so much into the hyperbolical style, one knows not how far he must be reduced. But this reasoning seems natural: If *Rome* was built in so scattered a manner as *Dionysius* says, and ran so much into the country, there must have been very few streets where the houses were raised so high. It is only for want of room, that any body builds in that inconvenient manner."

    text: "All the best manuscripts of *Pliny* read the passage as here cited, and fix the compass of the walls of *Rome* to be thirteen miles. The question is, What *Pliny* means by 30,775 paces, and how that number was formed? The manner in which I conceive it, is this. *Rome* was a semicircular area of thirteen miles circumference. The Forum, and consequently the Milliarium, we know, was situated on the banks of the *Tyber*, and near the center of the circle, or upon the diameter of the semicircular area. Though there were thirty-seven gates to *Rome*, yet only twelve of them had straight streets, leading from them to the Milliarium. *Pliny*, therefore, having assigned the circumference of *Rome*, and knowing that that alone was not sufficient to give us a just notion of its surface, uses this farther method. He supposes all the streets, leading from the Milliarium to the twelve gates, to be laid together into one straight line, and supposes we run along that line, so as to count each gate once: In which case, he says, that the whole line is 30,775 paces: Or, in other words, that each street or radius of the semicircular area is upon an average two miles and a half; and the whole length of *Rome* is five miles, and its breadth about half as much, besides the scattered suburbs."

But (1.) a semicircular area, whose radius was only 800 paces, could never have a circumference near thirteen miles, the compass of *Rome* as assigned by *Pliny*. A radius of two miles and a half forms very nearly that circumference. (2.) There is an absurdity in supposing a city so built as to have streets running to its center from every gate in its circumference. These streets must interfere as they approach. (3.) This diminishes too much from the greatness of ancient *Rome*, and reduces that city below even *Bristol* or *Rotterdam*."

    text: "The sense which *Vossius* in his _Observationes variæ_ puts on this passage of *Pliny*, errs widely in the other extreme. One manuscript of no authority, instead of thirteen miles, has assigned thirty miles for the compass of the walls of *Rome*. And *Vossius* understands this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference; supposing, that as the *Tyber* formed the diameter, there were no walls built on that side. But (1.) this reading is allowed to be contrary to almost all the manuscripts. (2.) Why should *Pliny*, a concise writer, repeat the compass of the walls of *Rome* in two successive sentences? (3.) Why repeat it with so sensible a variation? (4.) What is the meaning of *Pliny*’s mentioning twice the *Milliarium*, if a line was measured that had no dependence on the *Milliarium*? (5.) *Aurelian*’s wall is said by *Vopiscus* to have been drawn _laxiore ambitu_, and to have comprehended all the buildings and suburbs on the north side of the *Tyber*; yet its compass was only fifty miles; and even here critics suspect some mistake or corruption in the text; since the walls, which remain, and which are supposed to be the same with *Aurelian*’s, exceed not twelve miles. It is not probable, that *Rome* would diminish from *Augustus* to *Aurelian*. It remained still the capital of the same empire; and none of the civil wars in that long period, except the tumults on the death of *Maximus* and *Balbinus*, ever affected the city. *Caracalla* is said by *Aurelius Victor* to have encreased *Rome*. (6.) There are no remains of ancient buildings, which mark any such greatness of *Rome*. *Vossius*’s reply to this objection seems absurd, that the rubbish would sink sixty or seventy feet under ground. It appears from *Spartian* (_in vita Severi_) that the five-mile stone _in via Lavicana_ was out of the city. (7.) *Olympiodorus* and *Publius Victor* fix the number of houses in *Rome* to be betwixt forty and fifty thousand. (8.) The very extravagance of the consequences drawn by this critic, as well as *Lipsius*|, if they be necessary, destroys the foundation on which they are grounded: That *Rome* contained fourteen millions of inhabitants; while the whole kingdom of *France* contains only five, according to his computation, &c."

But as *Pliny* was writing to the *Romans*, who perfectly knew the disposition of the streets, it is not strange he should take a circumstance for granted, which was so familiar to every body. Perhaps too, many of these gates led to wharfs upon the river."

      ^H^E says (in *Nerone*, cap. 30.) that a portico or piazza of it was 3000 feet long; “tanta laxitas ut porticus triplices milliarias haberet.” He cannot mean three miles. For the |whole extent of the house from the *Palatine* to the *Esquiline* was not near so great. So when *Vopisc.* in *Aureliano* mentions a portico in *Sallust*’s gardens, which he calls _porticus milliarensis_, it must be understood of a thousand feet. So also *Horace*: >¬“Nulla decempedis //Metata privatis opacam //Porticus exciplebat Arcton." ¬Lib. ii. ode 15.< So also in lib. i. satyr. 8. >“Mille pedes in fronte, trecentos cippus in agrum //Hic dabat.”<

    text: "^T^HE inhabitants of *Marseilles* lost not their superiority over the *Gauls* in commerce and the mechanic arts, till the *Roman* dominion turned the latter from arms to agriculture and civil life. See *Strabo*, lib. iv. That author, in several places, repeats the observation concerning the improvement arising from the *Roman* arts and civility: And he lived at the time when the change was new, and would be more sensible. So also *Pliny*: “Quis enim non, communicato orbe terrarum, majestate *Romani* imperii, profecisse vitam putet, commercio rerum ac societate festæ pacis, omniaque etiam, quæ occulta antea fuerant, in promiscuo usu facta.” Lib. xiv. proœm. “Numine deûm electa (speaking of *Italy*) quæ cœlum ipsum clarius faceret, sparsa congregaret imperia, ritusque molliret, & tot populorum discordes, ferasque linguas sermonis commercio contraheret ad colloquia, & humanitatem homini daret; breviterque, una cunctarum gentium in toto orbe patria fieret;” lib. ii. cap. 5. Nothing can be stronger to this purpose than the following passage from *Tertullian*, who lived about the age of *Severus*. “Certe quidem ipse orbis in promptu est, cultior de die & instructior pristino. Omnia jam pervia, omnia nota, omnia negotiosa. Sol|itudines famosas retro fundi amœnissimi obliteraverunt, silvas arva domuerunt, feras pecora fugaverunt; arenæ seruntur, saxa panguntur, paludes eliquantur, tantæ urbes, quantæ non casæ quondam. Jam nec insulæ horrent, nec scopuli terrent; ubique domus, ubique populus, ubique respublica, ubique vita. Summum testimonium frequentiæ humanæ, onerosi sumus mundo, vix nobis elementa sufficiunt; & necessitates arctiores, et querelæ apud omnes, dum jam nos natura non sustinet.” De anima, cap. 30. The air of rhetoric and declamation which appears in this passage, diminishes somewhat from its authority, but does not entirely destroy it. The same remark may be extended to the following passage of *Aristides* the sophist, who lived in the age of *Adrian*. “The whole world,” says he, addressing himself to the *Romans*, “seems to keep one holiday; and mankind, laying aside the sword which they formerly wore, now betake themselves to feasting and to joy. The cities, forgetting their ancient animosities, preserve only one emulation, which shall embellish itself most by every art and ornament; Theatres every where arise, amphitheatres, porticoes, aqueducts, temples, schools, academies; and one may safely pronounce, that the sinking world has been again raised by your auspicious empire. Nor have cities alone received an encrease of ornament and beauty; but the whole earth, like a garden or paradise, is cultivated and adorned: Insomuch, that such of mankind as are placed out of the limits of your empire (who are but few) seem to merit our sympathy and compassion.”"

    text: "It is remarkable, that though *Diodorus Siculus* makes the inhabitants of *Ægypt*, when conquered by the *Romans*, amount only to three millions|; yet *Joseph.* _de bello Jud._ lib. ii. cap. 16. says, that its inhabitants, excluding those of *Alexandria*, were seven millions and a half, in the reign of *Nero*: And he expressly says, that he drew this account from the books of the *Roman* publicans, who levied the poll-tax. *Strabo*, lib. xvii. praises the superior police of the *Romans* with regard to the finances of *Ægypt*, above that of its former monarchs: And no part of administration is more essential to the happiness of a people. Yet we read in *Athenæus*, (lib. i. cap. 25.) who flourished during the reign of the *Antonines*, that the town *Mareia*, near *Alexandria*, which was formerly a large city, had dwindled into a village. This is not, properly speaking, a contradiction. *Suidas* (*August.*) says, that the Emperor *Augustus*, having numbered the whole *Roman* empire, found it contained only 4,101,017 men ($ανδρες$). There is here surely some great mistake, either in the author or transcriber. But this authority, feeble as it is, may be sufficient to counterbalance the exaggerated accounts of *Herodotus* and *Diodorus Siculus* with regard to more early times."

It is written in dialogue, which is a method of composition that *Plutarch* commonly but little affects. The personages he introduces advance very wild, absurd, and contradictory opinions, more like the visionary systems or ravings of *Plato* than the plain sense of *Plutarch*. There runs also through the whole an air of superstition and credulity, which resembles very little the spirit that appears in other philosophical compositions of that author. For it is remarkable, that, though *Plutarch* be an historian as superstitious as *Herodotus* or *Livy*, yet there is scarcely, in all antiquity, a philosopher less superstitious, excepting *Cicero* and *Lucian*. I must therefore confess, that a passage of *Plutarch*, cited from this discourse, has much less authority with me, than if it had been found in most of his other compositions."
