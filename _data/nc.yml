    text: "<p><strong>T</strong>HE vulgar are apt to carry all <em>national characters</em> to extremes; and having once established it as a principle, that any people are knavish, or cowardly, or ignorant, they will admit of no exception, but comprehend every individual under the same censure. Men of sense condemn these undistinguishing judgments: Though at the same time, they allow, that each nation has a peculiar set of manners, and that some particular qualities are more frequently to be met with among one people than among their neighbours. The common people in <b>Switzerland</b> have probably more honesty than those of the same rank in <b>Ireland</b>; and every prudent man will, from that circumstance alone, make a difference in the trust which he reposes in each. We have reason to expect <span class='page-break'>|</span>greater wit and gaiety in a <b>Frenchman</b> than in a <b>Spaniard</b>; though <b>Cervantes</b> was born in <b>Spain</b>. An <b>Englishman</b> will naturally be supposed to have more knowledge than a <b>Dane</b>; though <b>Tycho Brahe</b> was a native of <b>Denmark</b>.</p>"

    text: "<p>Different reasons are assigned for these <em>national characters</em>; while some account for them from <em>moral</em>, others from <em>physical</em> causes. By <em>moral</em> causes, I mean all circumstances, which are fitted to work on the mind as motives or reasons, and which render a peculiar set of manners habitual to us. Of this kind are, the nature of the government, the revolutions of public affairs, the plenty or penury in which the people live, the situation of the nation with regard to its neighbours, and such like circumstances. By <em>physical</em> causes I mean those qualities of the air and climate, which are supposed to work insensibly on the temper, by altering the tone and habit of the body, and giving a particular complexion, which, though reflection and reason may sometimes overcome it, will yet prevail among the generality of mankind, and have an influence on their manners.</p>"

As poverty and hard labour debase the minds of the common people, and render them unfit for any science and ingenious profession; so where any government becomes very oppressive to all its subjects, it must have a proportional effect on their temper and genius, and must banish all the liberal arts from among them.</p>"

For as chymists observe, that spirits, when raised to a certain height, are all the same, from whatever materials they be extracted; so these men, being elevated above humanity, acquire a uniform character, which is entirely their own, and which, in my opinion, is, generally speaking, not the most amiable that is to be met with in human society.

    text: "<p>The human mind is of a very imitative nature; nor is it possible for any set of men to converse often together, without acquiring a similitude of manners, and communicating to each other their vices as well as virtues. The propensity to company and society is strong in all rational creatures; and the same disposition, which gives us this propensity, makes us enter deeply into each other’s sentiments, and causes like passions and inclinations to run, as it were, by contagion, through the whole club or knot of companions. Where a number of men are united into one political body, the occasions of their intercourse must be so frequent, for defence, commerce, and government, that, together with the same speech or lan<span class='page-break'>|</span>guage, they must acquire a resemblance in their manners, and have a common or national character, as well as a personal one, peculiar to each individual. Now though nature produces all kinds of temper and understanding in great abundance, it does not follow, that she always produces them in like proportions, and that in every society the ingredients of industry and indolence, valour and cowardice, humanity and brutality, wisdom and folly, will be mixed after the same manner. In the infancy of society, if any of these dispositions be found in greater abundance than the rest, it will naturally prevail in the composition, and give a tincture to the national character. Or should it be asserted, that no species of temper can reasonably be presumed to predominate, even in those contracted societies, and that the same proportions will always be preserved in the mixture; yet surely the persons in credit and authority, being still a more contracted body, cannot always be presumed to be of the same character; and their influence on the manners of the people, must, at all times, be very considerable. If on the first establishment of a republic, a <b>Brutus</b> should be placed in authority, and be transported with such an enthusiasm for liberty and public good, as to overlook all the ties of nature, as well as private interest, such an illustrious example will naturally have an effect on the whole society, and kindle the same passion in every bosom. Whatever it be that forms the manners of one generation, the next must imbibe a deeper tincture of the same dye; men being more susceptible of all impressions during infancy, and retaining these impressions as long as they remain in the world. I assert, then, that all national characters, where they depend not on fixed <em>moral</em> causes, proceed from such accidents as these, and that physical causes have no discernible operation on the human mind. It is a maxim in all philosophy, that causes, which do not appear, are to be considered as not existing.</p>"

    text: "<p><em>First</em>. We may observe, that, where a very extensive government has been established for many centuries, it spreads a national character over the whole empire, and communicates to every part a similarity of manners.

In small governments, which are contiguous, the people have notwithstanding a different character, and are often as distinguishable in their manners as the most distant nations. <b>Athens</b> and <b>Thebes</b> were but a short day’s journey from each other; though the <b>Athenians</b> were as remarkable for ingenuity, politeness, and gaiety, as the <b>Thebans</b> for dulness, rusticity, and a phlegmatic temper. <b>Plutarch</b>, discoursing of the effects of air on the minds of men, observes, that the inhabitants of the <b>Piræum</b> possessed very different tempers from those of the higher town in <b>Athens</b>, which was distant about four miles from the former: But I believe no one attributes the difference of manners in <b>Wapping</b> and St. <b>James</b>’s, to a difference of air or climate.</p>"

Where any set of men, scattered over distant nations, maintain a close society or communication together, they acquire a similitude of manners, and have but little in common with the nations amongst whom they live. Thus the <b>Jews</b> in <b>Europe</b>, and the <b>Armenians</b> in the east, have a peculiar character; and the former are as much noted for fraud, as the latter for probity<sup><a href='#n4'>[4]</a></sup>.

    text: "<p><em>Seventhly</em>. The manners of a people change very considerably from one age to another; either by great alterations in <span class='page-break'>|</span>their government, by the mixtures of new people, or by that inconstancy, to which all human affairs are subject. The ingenuity, industry, and activity of the ancient <b>Greeks</b> have nothing in common with the stupidity and indolence of the present inhabitants of those regions. Candour, bravery, and love of liberty formed the character of the ancient <b>Romans</b>; as subtilty, cowardice, and a slavish disposition do that of the modern. The old <b>Spaniards</b> were restless, turbulent, and so addicted to war, that many of them killed themselves, when deprived of their arms by the <b>Romans</b><sup><a href='#n5'>[5]</a></sup>. One would find an equal difficulty at present, (at least one would have found it fifty years ago) to rouze up the modern <b>Spaniards</b> to arms. The <b>Batavians</b> were all soldiers of fortune, and hired themselves into the <b>Roman</b> armies. Their posterity make use of foreigners for the same purpose that the <b>Romans</b> did their ancestors. Though some few strokes of the <b>French</b> character be the same with that which <b>Cæsar</b> has ascribed to the <b>Gauls</b>; yet what comparison between the civility, humanity, and knowledge of the modern inhabitants of that country, and the ignorance, barbarity, and grossness of the ancient? Not to insist upon the great difference between the present possessors of <b>Britain</b>, and those before the <b>Roman</b> conquest; we may observe that our ancestors, a few centuries ago, were sunk into the most abject superstition, last century they were inflamed with the most furious enthusiasm, and are now settled into the most cool indifference with regard to religious matters, that is to be found in any nation of the world.</p>"

    text: "<p><em>Eighthly</em>. Where several neighbouring nations have a very close communication together, either by policy, commerce, or travelling, they acquire a similitude of manners, proportioned to the communication. Thus all the <b>Franks</b> appear to have a uniform character to the eastern nations. The differences among them are like the peculiar accents of different provinces, which are not distinguishable, except by an ear accustomed to them, and which commonly escape a foreigner.</p>"

    text: "<p><em>Ninthly</em>. We may often remark a wonderful mixture of manners and characters in the same nation, speaking the same language, and subject to the same government: And in this particular the <b>English</b> are the most remarkable of any people, that perhaps ever were in the world. Nor is this to be ascribed to the mutability and uncertainty of their climate, or to any other <em>physical</em> causes; since all these causes take place in the neighbouring country of <b>Scotland</b>, without having the same effect. Where the government of a nation is altogether republican, it is apt to beget a peculiar set of manners. Where it is altogether monarchical, it is more apt to have the same effect; the imitation of superiors spreading the national manners faster among the people. If the governing part of a state consist altogether of merchants, as in <b>Holland</b>, their uniform way of life will fix their character. If it consists chiefly of nobles and landed gentry, like <b>Germany</b>, <b>France</b>, and <b>Spain</b>, the same effect follows. The genius of a particular sect or religion is also apt to mould the manners of a people. But the <b>English</b> government is a mixture of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. The people in authority are composed of gentry and merchants. All sects of religion are to be found among them. And the great liberty and independency, which every man enjoys, allows him to display the manners peculiar to him. Hence the <b>English</b>, of any people in the universe, have the least of a national character; unless this very singularity may pass for such.</p>"

    text: "<p>If the characters of men depended on the air and climate, the degrees of heat and cold should naturally be expected to have a mighty influence; since nothing has a greater effect on all plants and irrational animals. And indeed there is some reason to think, that all the nations, which live beyond the polar circles or between the tropics, are inferior to the rest of the species, and are incapable of all the higher attainments of the human mind. The poverty and misery of the northern inhabitants of the globe, and the indolence of the southern, from their few necessities, may, perhaps, account for this remarkable difference, without our having recourse to <em>physical</em> <span class='page-break'>|</span>causes. This however is certain, that the characters of nations are very promiscuous in the temperate climates, and that almost all the general observations, which have been formed of the more southern or more northern people in these climates, are found to be uncertain and fallacious<sup><a href='#n6'>[6]</a></sup>.</p>"

But this observation holds not universally. The <b>Arabic</b> is uncouth and disagreeable: The <b>Muscovite</b> soft and musical. Energy, strength, and harshness form the character of the <b>Latin</b> tongue: The <b>Italian</b> is the most liquid, smooth, and effeminate language that can possibly be imagined. Every language will depend somewhat on the manners of the people; but much more on that original stock of words and sounds, which they received from their ancestors, and which remain unchangeable, even while their manners admit of the greatest alterations. Who can doubt, but the <b>English</b> are at present a more polite and knowing people than the <b>Greeks</b> were for several ages after the siege of <b>Troy</b>? Yet is there no comparison between the language of <b>Milton</b> and that of <b>Homer</b>. Nay, the greater are the alterations and improvements, which happen in the manners of a people, the less can be expected in their language.

    text: "<p>Lord <b>Bacon</b> has observed, that the inhabitants of the south are, in general, more ingenious than those of the north; but that, where the native of a cold climate has genius, he rises to a higher pitch than can be reached by the southern wits. This observation a late<sup><a href='#n7'>[7]</a></sup> writer confirms, by comparing the southern wits to cucumbers, which are commonly all good in their kind; but at best are an insipid fruit: While the northern geniuses are like melons, of which not one in fifty is good; but when it is so, it has an exquisite relish. I believe this remark <span class='page-break'>|</span>may be allowed just, when confined to the <b>European</b> nations, and to the present age, or rather to the preceding one: But I think it may be accounted for from moral causes. All the sciences and liberal arts have been imported to us from the south; and it is easy to imagine, that, in the first ardor of application, when excited by emulation and by glory, the few, who were addicted to them, would carry them to the greatest height, and stretch every nerve, and every faculty, to reach the pinnacle of perfection. Such illustrious examples spread knowledge every where, and begot an universal esteem for the sciences: After which, it is no wonder, that industry relaxes; while men meet not with suitable encouragement, nor arrive at such distinction by their attainments. The universal diffusion of learning among a people, and the entire banishment of gross ignorance and rusticity, is, therefore, seldom attended with any remarkable perfection in particular persons. It seems to be taken for granted in the dialogue <em>de Oratoribus</em>, that knowledge was much more common in <b>Vespasian</b>’s age than in that of <b>Cicero</b> and <b>Augustus</b>. <b>Quintilian</b> also complains of the profanation of learning, by its becoming too common. “Formerly,” says <b>Juvenal</b>, “science was confined to <b>Greece</b> and <b>Italy</b>. Now the whole world emulates <b>Athens</b> and <b>Rome</b>. Eloquent <b>Gaul</b> has taught <b>Britain</b>, knowing in the laws. Even <b>Thule</b> entertains thoughts of hiring rhetoricians for its instruction<sup><a href='#n8'>[8]</a></sup>.” This state of learning <span class='page-break'>|</span>is remarkable; because <b>Juvenal</b> is himself the last of the <b>Roman</b> writers, that possessed any degree of genius. Those, who succeeded, are valued for nothing but the matters of fact, of which they give us information. I hope the late conversion of <b>Muscovy</b> to the study of the sciences will not prove a like prognostic to the present period of learning.</p>"

But I am apt to think, that this has happened by accident. The ancient <b>Romans</b> seem to have been a candid sincere people, as are the modern <b>Turks</b>. But if we must needs suppose, that this event has arisen from fixed causes, we may only conclude from it, that all extremes are apt to concur, and are commonly attended with the same consequences.

If courage be preserved, it must be by discipline, example, and opinion.

One can assign a very probable <em>physical</em> cause for this difference. Wine and distilled waters warm the frozen blood in the colder climates, and fortify men against the injuries of the weather: As the genial heat of the sun, in the countries exposed to his beams, inflames the blood, and exalts the passion between the sexes.</p>"

    text: "<p>Perhaps too, the matter may be accounted for by <em>moral</em> causes. All strong liquors are rarer in the north, and consequently are more coveted. <b>Diodorus Siculus</b><sup><a href='#n10'>[10]</a></sup> tells us, that the <b>Gauls</b> in his time were great drunkards, and much addicted to wine; chiefly, I suppose, from its rarity and novelty. On the other hand, the heat in the southern climates, obliging men and women to go half naked, thereby renders their frequent commerce more dangerous, and inflames their mutual passion. This makes parents and husbands more jealous and reserved; which still farther inflames the passion. Not to mention, that, as women ripen sooner in the southern regions, it is necessary to observe greater jealousy and care in their education; it being evident, that a girl of twelve cannot possess equal discretion to govern this passion, with one who feels not its violence till she be seventeen or eighteen. Nothing so much encourages the passion of love as ease and leisure, or is more destructive to it than industry and hard labour; and as the necessities of men are evidently fewer in the warm climates than in the cold ones, this circumstance alone may make a considerable difference between them.</p>"

    text: "<p>But perhaps the fact is doubtful, that nature has, either from moral or physical causes, distributed these respective <span class='page-break'>|</span>inclinations to the different climates. The ancient <b>Greeks</b>, though born in a warm climate, seem to have been much addicted to the bottle; nor were their parties of pleasure any thing but matches of drinking among men, who passed their time altogether apart from the fair. Yet when <b>Alexander</b> led the <b>Greeks</b> into <b>Persia</b>, a still more southern climate, they multiplied their debauches of this kind, in imitation of the <b>Persian</b> manners<sup><a href='#n11'>[11]</a></sup>. So honourable was the character of a drunkard among the <b>Persians</b>, that <b>Cyrus</b> the younger, soliciting the sober <b>Lacedemonians</b> for succour against his brother <b>Artaxerxes</b>, claims it chiefly on account of his superior endowments, as more valorous, more bountiful, and a better drinker<sup><a href='#n12'>[12]</a></sup>. <b>Darius Hystaspes</b> made it be inscribed on his tomb-stone, among his other virtues and princely qualities, that no one could bear a greater quantity of liquor. You may obtain any thing of the <b>Negroes</b> by offering them strong drink; and may easily prevail with them to sell, not only their children, but their wives and mistresses, for a cask of brandy. In <b>France</b> and <b>Italy</b> few drink pure wine, except in the greatest heats of summer; and indeed, it is then almost as necessary, in order to recruit the spirits, evaporated by heat, as it is in <b>Sweden</b>, during the winter, in order to warm the bodies congealed by the rigour of the season.</p>"

And this is agreeable to the analogy of nature. The races of animals never degenerate when carefully tended; and horses, in particular, always show their blood in their shape, spirit, and swiftness: But a coxcomb may beget a philosopher; as a man of virtue may leave a worthless progeny.</p>"

When love goes beyond a certain pitch, it renders men jealous, and cuts off the free intercourse between the sexes, on which the politeness of a nation will commonly much depend. And if we would subtilize and refine upon this point, we might observe, that the people, in very temperate climates, are the most likely to attain all sorts of improvement; their blood not being so inflamed as to render them jealous, and yet being warm enough to make them set a due value on the charms and endowments of the fair sex.</p>"

This seems to me a presumption, that the ancients owed all their refinement and civility to books and study; for which, indeed, a soldier’s life is not so well calculated. Company and the world is their sphere. And if there be any politeness to be learned from company, they will certainly have a considerable share of it.</p>"

    text: "<p><strong>T</strong>H<b>ough</b> all mankind have a strong propensity to religion at certain times and in certain dispositions; yet are there few or none, who have it to that degree, and with that constancy, which is requisite to support the character of this profession. It must, therefore, happen, that clergymen, being drawn from the common mass of mankind, as people are to other employments, by the views of profit, the greater part, though no atheists or free-thinkers, will find it necessary, on particular occasions, to feign more devotion than <span class='page-break'>|</span>they are, at that time, possessed of, and to maintain the appearance of fervor and seriousness, even when jaded with the exercises of their religion, or when they have their minds engaged in the common occupations of life. They must not, like the rest of the world, give scope to their natural movements and sentiments: They must set a guard over their looks and words and actions: And in order to support the veneration paid them by the multitude, they must not only keep a remarkable reserve, but must promote the spirit of superstition, by a continued grimace and hypocrisy. This dissimulation often destroys the candor and ingenuity of their temper, and makes an irreparable breach in their character.</p>"

    text: "<p>If by chance any of them be possessed of a temper more susceptible of devotion than usual, so that he has but little occasion for hypocrisy to support the character of his profession; it is so natural for him to over-rate this advantage, and to think that it atones for every violation of morality, that frequently he is not more virtuous than the hypocrite. And though few dare openly avow those exploded opinions, <em>that every thing is lawful to the saints</em>, and <em>that they alone have property in their goods</em>; yet may we observe, that these principles lurk in every bosom, and represent a zeal for religious observances as so great a merit, that it may compensate for many vices and enormities. This observation is so common, that all prudent men are on their guard, when they meet with any extraordinary appearance of religion; though at the same time, they confess, that there are many exceptions to this general rule, and that probity and superstition, or even probity and fanaticism, are not altogether and in every instance incompatible.</p>"

    text: "<p>The temper of religion is grave and serious; and this is the character required of priests, which confines them to strict rules of decency, and commonly prevents irregularity and intemperance amongst them. The gaiety, much less the excesses of pleasure, is not permitted in that body; and this virtue is, perhaps, the only one which they owe to their profession. In religions, indeed, founded on speculative principles, and where public discourses make a part of religious service, it may also be supposed that the clergy will have a considerable share in the learning of the times; though it is certain that their taste in eloquence will always be greater than their proficiency in reasoning and philosophy. But whoever possesses the other noble virtues of humanity, meekness, and moderation, as very many of them, no doubt, do, is beholden for them to nature or reflection, not to the genius of his calling.</p>"
