    text: "<p><b>The</b> Character of Sir <b>Robert Walpole</b> was drawn some Months ago, when that Great <b>Man</b> was in the Zenith of his Power. I must confess, that, at present, when he seems to be upon the Decline, I am inclin’d to think more favourably of him, and to suspect, that the Antipathy, which every true born <em>Briton</em> naturally bears to Ministers of State, inspir’d me with some Prejudice against him. The impartial <b>Reader</b>, if any such there be; or Posterity, if such a Trifle can reach them, will best be able to correct my Mistakes in this Particular.</p>"
