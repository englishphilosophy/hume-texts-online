    content: "<p><strong>I</strong>T was the practice of the antients to address their compositions only to friends and equals, and to render their dedications monuments of regard and affection, not of servility and flattery. In those days of ingenious and candid liberty, a dedication did honour to the person to whom it was addressed, without degrading the author. If any particular appeared towards the patron, it was at least the partiality of friendship and affection.</p>"

    content: "<p><b>Another</b> instance of true liberty, of which antient times can alone afford us an example, is the liberty of thought, which engaged men of letters, however different in their abstract opinions, to maintain a mutual friendship and regard; and never to quarrel about principles, while they agreed in inclinations and manners. Science was often the subject of disputation, never of animosity. <em>Cicero</em>, an academic, addressed his philosophical treatises, sometimes to <em>Brutus</em>, a stoic; sometimes to <em>Atticus</em>, an epicurean.</p>"

    content: "<p><b>I have</b> been seized with a strong desire of renewing these laudable practices of antiquity, by addressing the following dissertations to you, my good friend: For such I will ever call and esteem you, notwithstanding the opposition, which prevails between us, with regard to many of our speculative tenets. These differences of opinion I have only found to enliven our conversation; while our common passion for science and letters served as a cement to our friendship. I still admired your genius, even when I imagined, that you lay under the influence of prejudice; and you sometimes told me, that you excused my errors, on account of the candor and sincerity, which, you thought, accompanied them.</p>"

    content: "<p><b>But</b> to tell truth, it is less my admiration of your fine genius, which has engaged me to make this address to you, than my esteem of your character and my affection to your person. That generosity of mind which ever accompanies you; that cordiality of friendship, that spirited honour and integrity, have long interested me strongly in your behalf, and have made me desirous, that a monument of our mutual amity should be publicly erected, and, if possible, be preserved to posterity.</p>"

    content: "<p><del>I own</del><ins title='originally not in small caps; edited to match the consistent preference elsewhere'><b>I own</b></ins> too, that I have the ambition to be the first who shall in public express his admiration of your noble tragedy of <b>Douglas</b>; one of the most interesting and pathetic pieces, that was ever exhibited on any theatre. Should I give it preference to the <em>Merope</em> of <em>Maffei</em>, and to that of <em>Voltaire</em>, which it resembles in its subject; should I affirm, that it contained more fire and spirit than the former, more tenderness and simplicity than the latter; I might be accused of partiality: And how could I entirely acquit myself, after the professions of friendship, which I have made you? But the unfeigned tears which flowed from every eye, in the numerous representations which were made of it on this theatre; the unparalleled command, which you appeared to have over every affection of the human breast: These are incontestible proofs, that you possess the true theatric genius of <em>Shakespear</em> and <em>Otway</em>, refined from the unhappy barbarism of the one, and licentiousness of the other.</p>"

    content: "<p><b>My</b> enemies, you know, and, I own, even sometimes my friends, have reproached me with the love of paradoxes and singular opinions; and I expect to be exposed to the same imputation, on account of the character, which I have here given of your <b>Douglas</b>. I shall be told, no doubt, that I had artfully chosen the only time, when this high esteem of that piece could be regarded as a paradox, to wit, before its publication; and that not being able to contradict in this particular the sentiments of the public, I have, at least, resolved to go before them. But I shall be amply compensated for all these pleasantries, if you accept this testimony of my regard, and believe me to be, with the greatest sincerity,<br><br><span class='tab'></span><b>Dear Sir,</b><br><br><span class='tab'></span><span class='tab'></span><em>Your most affectionate Friend,</em><br><br><span class='tab'></span><span class='tab'></span><span class='tab'></span><em>and humble servant,</em><br><b>Edinburgh</b>, 3,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Jan.</em> 1757.<br><span class='tab'></span><span class='tab'></span><span class='tab'></span><span class='tab'></span><b>David Hume.</b></p>"
