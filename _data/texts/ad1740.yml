    content: "<p><em><strong>I</strong> THINK it proper to inform the public, that tho' this be a third volume of the </em>Treatise of Human Nature<em>, yet 'tis in some measure independent of the other two, and requires not that the reader shou'd enter into all the abstract reasonings contain'd in them. I am hopeful it may be understood by ordinary readers, with as little attention as is usually given to any books of reasoning. It must only be observ'd, that I continue to make use of the terms, </em>impressions<em> and </em>ideas<em>, in the same sense as formerly; and that by impressions I mean our stronger perceptions, such as our sensations, affections and sentiments; and by ideas the fainter perceptions, or the copies of these in the memory and imagination.</em></p>"
