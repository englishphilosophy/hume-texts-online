    text: "<p><strong>T</strong>HERE is very little ground, either from reason or observation, to conclude the world eternal or incorruptible. The continual and rapid motion of matter, the violent revolutions with which every part is agitated, the changes remarked in the heavens, the plain traces as well as tradition of an universal deluge, or general convulsion of the elements; all these prove strongly the mortality of this fabric of the world, and its passage, by corruption or dissolution, from one state or order to another. It must therefore, as well as each individual form which it contains, have its infancy, youth, manhood, and old age; and it is probable, that, in all these variations, man, equally with every animal and vegetable, will partake. In the flourishing age of the world, it may be expected, that the <span class='page-break'>|</span>human species should possess greater vigour both of mind and body, more prosperous health, higher spirits, longer life, and a stronger inclination and power of generation. But if the general system of things, and human society of course, have any such gradual revolutions, they are too slow to be discernible in that short period which is comprehended by history and tradition. Stature and force of body, length of life, even courage and extent of genius, seem hitherto to have been naturally, in all ages, pretty much the same. The arts and sciences, indeed, have flourished in one period, and have decayed in another: But we may observe, that, at the time when they rose to greatest perfection among one people, they were perhaps totally unknown to all the neighbouring nations; and though they universally decayed in one age, yet in a succeeding generation they again revived, and diffused themselves over the world. As far, therefore, as observation reaches, there is no universal difference discernible in the human species; and though it were allowed, that the universe, like an animal body, had a natural progress from infancy to old age; yet as it must still be uncertain, whether, at present, it be advancing to its point of perfection, or declining from it, we cannot thence presuppose any decay in human nature<sup><a href='#n1'>[1]</a></sup>. To prove, therefore, or account for that superior populousness of antiquity, which is commonly supposed, by the imaginary youth or vigour of the world, will scarcely be admitted by any just reasoner. These <em>general physical</em> causes ought entirely to be excluded from this question.</p>"

    text: "<p>There are indeed some more <em>particular physical</em> causes of importance. Diseases are mentioned in antiquity, which are almost unknown to modern medicine; and new diseases have arisen and propagated themselves, of which there are no traces in ancient history. In this particular we may observe, upon comparison, that the disadvantage is much on the side of the moderns. Not to mention some others of less moment; the small-pox <del>commit</del><ins title='originally 'commit'; 'commits' in earlier editions, which is clearly what was intended'>commits</ins> such ravages, as would almost alone account for the great superiority ascribed to ancient times. The tenth or the twelfth part of mankind, destroyed every gener<span class='page-break'>|</span>ation, should make a vast difference, it may be thought, in the numbers of the people; and when joined to venereal distempers, a new plague diffused every where, this disease is perhaps equivalent, by its constant operation, to the three great scourges of mankind, war, pestilence, and famine. Were it certain, therefore, that ancient times were more populous than the present, and could no moral causes be assigned for so great a change; these physical causes alone, in the opinion of many, would be sufficient to give us satisfaction on that head.</p>"

For my part, the matter appears to me so uncertain, that, as I intend to throw together some reflections on that head, I shall intermingle the enquiry concerning <em>causes</em> with that concerning <em>facts;</em> which ought never to be admitted, where the facts can be ascertained with any tolerable assurance. We shall, <em>first</em>, consider whether it be probable, from what we know of the situation of society in both periods, that antiquity must have been more populous; <em>secondly</em>, whether in reality it was so. If I can make it appear, that the conclusion is not so certain as is pretended, in favour of antiquity, it is all I aspire to.</p>"

    text: "<p>In general, we may observe, that the question, with regard to the comparative populousness of ages or kingdoms, implies important consequences, and commonly determines concerning the preference of their whole police, their manners, and the constitution of their government. For as there is in all men, both male and female, a desire and power of generation, more active than is ever universally exerted, the restraints, which they lie under, must proceed from some difficulties in their situation, which it belongs to a wise legislature carefully to observe and remove. Almost every man who thinks he can maintain a family will have one; and the human species, at this rate of propagation, would more than double every generation. How fast do mankind multiply in every colony or new settlement; where it is an easy matter to provide for a family; and where men are nowise straitened or confined, as in long established governments? History tells us frequently of plagues, which have swept away the third or fourth part of a people: Yet in a generation or two, the destruction was not perceived; and the society had again acquired their former number. The lands which were cultivated, the houses built, the commodities raised, the riches acquired, enabled the people, who escaped, immediately to marry, and to rear families, <span class='page-break'>|</span>which supplied the place of those who had perished<sup><a href='#n3'>[3]</a></sup>. And for a like reason, every wise, just, and mild government, by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure, will always abound most in people, as well as in commodities and riches. A country, indeed, whose climate and soil are fitted for vines, will naturally be more populous than one which produces corn only, and that more populous than one which is only fitted for pasturage. In general, warm climates, as the necessities of the inhabitants are there fewer, and vegetation more powerful, are likely to be most populous: But if every thing else be equal, it seems natural to expect, that, wherever there are most happiness and virtue, and the wisest institutions, there will also be most people.</p>"

    text: "<p>The chief difference between the <em>domestic</em> œconomy of the ancients and that of the moderns consists in the practice of slavery, which prevailed among the former, and which has been abolished for some centuries throughout the greater part of <b>Europe</b>. Some passionate admirers of the ancients, and zealous partizans of civil liberty, (for these sentiments, as they are, both of them, in the main, extremely just, are found to be almost inseparable) cannot forbear regretting the loss of this institution; and whilst they brand all submission to the government of a single person with the harsh denomination of slavery, they would gladly reduce the greater part of mankind to real slavery and subjection. But to one who considers coolly on the subject it will appear, that human nature, in general, really enjoys more liberty at present, in the most arbitrary government of <b>Europe</b>, than it ever did during the most flourishing period of ancient times. As much as submission to a petty prince, whose dominions extend not beyond a single city, is more grievous than obedience to a great monarch; so much is domestic slavery more cruel and oppressive than any civil subjection whatsoever. The more the master is removed from us in place and rank, the greater liberty we enjoy; the less are our actions inspected and controled; and the fainter that cruel comparison becomes between our own subjection, and the freedom, and even dominion of another. The remains which are found of domestic slavery, in the <b>American</b> colonies, and among some <b>European</b> nations, would never surely create a desire of rendering it more universal. The little humanity, commonly observed in persons, accustomed, from their infancy, to exercise so great authority over their fellow-creatures, and to trample upon human nature, were sufficient <span class='page-break'>|</span>alone to disgust us with that unbounded dominion. Nor can a more probable reason be assigned for the severe, I might say, barbarous manners of ancient times, than the practice of domestic slavery; by which every man of rank was rendered a petty tyrant, and educated amidst the flattery, submission, and low debasement of his slaves.</p>"

    text: "<p>But our present business is only to consider the influence of slavery on the populousness of a state. It is pretended, that, in this particular, the ancient practice had infinitely the advantage, and was the chief cause of that extreme populousness, which is supposed in those times. At present, all masters discourage the marrying of their male servants, and admit not by any means the marriage of the female, who are then supposed altogether incapacitated for their service. But where the property of the servants is lodged in the master, their marriage forms his riches, and brings him a succession of slaves that supply the place of those whom age and infirmity have disabled. He encourages, therefore, their propagation as much as that of his cattle; rears the young with the same care; and <span class='page-break'>|</span>educates them to some art or calling, which may render them more useful or valuable to him. The opulent are, by this policy, interested in the being at least, though not in the well-being of the poor; and enrich themselves, by encreasing the number and industry of those who are subjected to them. Each man, being a sovereign in his own family, has the same interest with regard to it, as the prince with regard to the state; and has not, like the prince, any opposite motives of ambition or vain-glory, which may lead him to depopulate his little sovereignty. All of it is, at all times, under his eye; and he has leisure to inspect the most minute detail of the marriage and education of his subjects<sup><a href='#n13'>[13]</a></sup>.</p>"

    text: "<p>Such are the consequences of domestic slavery, according to the first aspect and appearance of things: But if we enter more deeply into the subject, we shall perhaps find reason to retract our hasty determinations. The comparison is shocking between the management of human creatures and that of cattle; but being extremely just, when applied to the present subject, it may be proper to trace the consequences of it. At the capital, near all great cities, in all populous, rich, industrious provinces, few cattle are bred. Provisions, lodging, attendance, labour are there dear; and men find their account better in buying the cattle, after they come to a certain age, from the remoter and cheaper countries. These are consequently the only breeding countries for cattle; and by a parity of reason, for men too, when the latter are put on the same footing with the former. To rear a child in <b>London</b>, till he could be serviceable, would cost much dearer, than to buy one of the same age from <b>Scotland</b> or <b>Ireland</b>; where he had been bred in a cottage, covered with rags, and fed on oatmeal or potatoes. Those who had slaves, therefore, in all the richer and <span class='page-break'>|</span>more populous countries, would discourage the pregnancy of the females, and either prevent or destroy the birth. The human species would perish in those places where it ought to encrease the fastest; and a perpetual recruit be wanted from the poorer and more desert provinces. Such a continued drain would tend mightily to depopulate the state, and render great cities ten times more destructive than with us; where every man is master of himself, and provides for his children from the powerful instinct of nature, not the calculations of sordid interest. If <b>London</b>, at present, without much encreasing, needs a yearly recruit from the country, of 5000 people, as is usually computed, what must it require, if the greater part of the tradesmen and common people were slaves, and were hindered from breeding by their avaricious masters?</p>"

The inhuman sports exhibited at <b>Rome</b>, may justly be considered too as an effect of the people’s contempt for slaves, and was also a great cause of the general inhumanity of their princes and rulers. Who can read the accounts of the amphitheatrical entertainments without horror? Or who is surprised, that the emperors should treat that people in the same way the people treated their inferiors? One’s humanity is apt to renew the barbarous wish of <b>Caligula</b>, that the people had but one neck: A man could almost be pleased, by a single blow, to put an end to such a race of monsters. You may thank God, says the author above cited, (<em>epist.</em> 7.) addressing himself to the <b>Roman</b> people, that you have a master (to wit the mild and merciful <b>Nero</b>) who is incapable of learning cruelty from your example. This was spoke in the beginning of his reign: But he fitted them very well afterwards; and, no doubt, was considerably improved by the sight of the barbarous objects, to which he had, from his infancy, been accustomed.</p>"

    text: "<p><strong>A</strong>S <em>servus</em> was the name of the genus, and verna of the species, without any correlative, this forms a strong presumption, that the latter were by far the least numerous. It is an universal observation which we may form upon language, that where two related parts of a whole bear any proportion to each other, in numbers, rank or consideration, there are always correlative terms invented, which answer to both the parts, and express their mutual relation. If they bear no proportion to each other, the term is only invented for the less, and marks its distinction from the whole. Thus <em>man</em> and <em>woman</em>, <em>master</em> and <em>servant</em>, <em>father</em> and <em>son</em>, <em>prince</em> and <em>subject</em>, <em>stranger</em> and <em>citizen</em>, are correlative terms. But the words <em>seaman</em>, <em>carpenter</em>, <em>smith</em>, <em>tailor</em>, &c. have no correspondent terms, which express those who are no seamen, no carpenters, <em>&c.</em> Languages differ very much with regard to the particular words where this distinction obtains; and may thence afford very strong inferences, concerning the manners and customs of different nations. The military government of the <b>Roman</b> emperors had exalted the soldiery so high, that they balanced all the other orders of the state: Hence <em>miles</em> and <em>paganus</em> became relative terms; a thing, till then, unknown to ancient, and still so to modern languages. Modern superstition exalted the clergy so high, that they overbalanced the whole state: Hence <em>clergy</em> and <em>laity</em> are terms opposed in all modern languages; and in these alone. And from the same principles I infer, that if the number of slaves bought by the <b>Romans</b> from foreign countries, had not extremely exceeded those which were bred at home, <em>verna</em> would have had a correlative, which would have expressed the former species of slaves. But these, it would seem, composed the main body of the ancient slaves, and the latter were but a few exceptions.</p>"

How much more must this happen in <b>European</b> countries, and in or near great cities? I shall add, that, from the experience of our planters, slavery is as little advantageous to the master as to the slave, wherever hired servants can be procured. A man is obliged to cloath and feed his slave; and he does no more for his servant: The price of the first purchase is, therefore, so much loss to him: not to mention, that the fear of punishment will never draw so much labour from a slave, as the dread of being turned off and not getting another service, will from a freeman.</p>"

It had even been doubted, whether a woman pregnant was morbid or vitiated; and it is determined, that she is sound, not on account of the value of her offspring, but because it is the natural part or office of women to bear children. “Si mulier prægnans venerit, inter omnes convenit sanam eam esse.

Upon the fall of the <b>Lacedæmonians</b>, Democracies were restored in many cities, and severe vengeance taken of the nobles, after the <b>Greek</b> manner. But matters did not end there. For the banished nobles, returning in many places, butchered their adversaries at <b>Phialæ</b>, in <b>Corinth</b>, in <b>Megara</b>, in <b>Phliasia</b>. In this last place they killed 300 of the people; but these again revolting, killed above 600 of the nobles, and banished the rest; lib. xv. p. 357. In <b>Arcadia</b> 1400 banished, besides many killed. The banished retired to <b>Sparta</b> and to <b>Pallantium</b>: The latter were delivered up to their countrymen, and all killed; lib. xv. p. 373. Of the banished from <b>Argos</b> and <b>Thebes</b>, there were 509 in the <b>Spartan</b> army; <em>id.</em> p. 374. Here is a detail of the most remarkable of <b>Agathocles</b>’s cruelties from the same author. The people before his usurpation had banished 600 nobles; lib. xix. p. 655. Afterwards that tyrant, in concurrence with the people, killed 4000 nobles, and banished 6000; <em>id.</em> p. 647. He killed 4000 people at <b>Gela</b>; <em>id.</em> p. 741.

The inhabitants of <b>Ægesta</b>, to the number of 40,000, were killed, man, woman, and child; and with tortures, for the sake of their money; <em>id.</em> p. 802. All the relations, to wit, father, brother, children, grandfather, of his <b>Libyan</b> army, killed; <em>id.</em> p. 803. He killed 7000 exiles after capitulation; <em>id.</em> p. 816. It is to be remarked, that <b>Agathocles</b> was a man of great sense and courage, and is not to be suspected of wanton cruelty, contrary to the maxims of his age.</p>"

It is dangerous to rely upon writers who deal in ridicule and satyr.

The plots in that kingdom are usually the workmanship of those persons,” <em>&c.</em> <del><b>Gulliver</b>s</del><ins title='the apostrophe is missing in the 1777 edition, but present in earlier editions'><b>Gulliver</b>’s</ins> <em>travels</em>. Such a representation might suit the government of <b>Athens</b>; not that of <b>England</b>, which is remarkable even in modern times, for humanity, justice, and liberty. Yet the Doctor’s satyr, though carried to extremes, as is usual with him, even beyond other satyrical writers, did not altogether want an object. The Bishop of <b>Rochester</b>, who was his friend, and of the same party, had been banished a little before by bill of attainder, with great justice, but without such a proof as was legal, or according to the strict forms of common law.</p>"

The question is, What <b>Pliny</b> means by 30,775 paces, and how that number was formed?

The Forum, and consequently the Milliarium, we know, was situated on the banks of the <b>Tyber</b>, and near the center of the circle, or upon the diameter of the semicircular area. Though there were thirty-seven gates to <b>Rome</b>, yet only twelve of them had straight streets, leading from them to the Milliarium. <b>Pliny</b>, therefore, having assigned the circumference of <b>Rome</b>, and knowing that that alone was not sufficient to give us a just notion of its surface, uses this farther method. He supposes all the streets, leading from the Milliarium to the twelve gates, to be laid together into one straight line, and supposes we run along that line, so as to count each gate once: In which case, he says, that the whole line is 30,775 paces: Or, in other words, that each street or radius of the semicircular area is upon an average two miles and a half; and the whole length of <b>Rome</b> is five miles, and its breadth about half as much, besides the scattered suburbs.</p>"

A radius of two miles and a half forms very nearly that circumference. (2.)

One manuscript of no authority, instead of thirteen miles, has assigned thirty miles for the compass of the walls of <b>Rome</b>. And <b>Vossius</b> understands this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference; supposing, that as the <b>Tyber</b> formed the diameter, there were no walls built on that side. But (1.) this reading is allowed to be contrary to almost all the manuscripts. (2.) Why should <b>Pliny</b>, a concise writer, repeat the compass of the walls of <b>Rome</b> in two successive sentences? (3.) Why repeat it with so sensible a variation? (4.) What is the meaning of <b>Pliny</b>’s mentioning twice the <b>Milliarium</b>, if a line was measured that had no dependence on the <b>Milliarium</b>? (5.) <b>Aurelian</b>’s wall is said by <b>Vopiscus</b> to have been drawn <em>laxiore ambitu</em>, and to have comprehended all the buildings and suburbs on the north side of the <b>Tyber</b>; yet its compass was only fifty miles; and even here critics suspect some mistake or corruption in the text; since the walls, which remain, and which are supposed to be the same with <b>Aurelian</b>’s, exceed not twelve miles. It is not probable, that <b>Rome</b> would diminish from <b>Augustus</b> to <b>Aurelian</b>. It remained still the capital of the same empire; and none of the civil wars in that long period, except the tumults on the death of <b>Maximus</b> and <b>Balbinus</b>, ever affected the city. <b>Caracalla</b> is said by <b>Aurelius Victor</b> to have encreased <b>Rome</b>. (6.)

    text: "<p><strong>T</strong>HE inhabitants of <b>Marseilles</b> lost not their superiority over the <b>Gauls</b> in commerce and the mechanic arts, till the <b>Roman</b> dominion turned the latter from arms to agriculture and civil life. See <b>Strabo</b>, lib. iv. That author, in several places, repeats the observation concerning the improvement arising from the <b>Roman</b> arts and civility: And he lived at the time when the change was new, and would be more sensible. So also <b>Pliny</b>: “Quis enim non, communicato orbe terrarum, majestate <b>Romani</b> imperii, profecisse vitam putet, commercio rerum ac societate festæ pacis, omniaque etiam, quæ occulta antea fuerant, in promiscuo usu facta.” Lib. xiv. proœm. “Numine deûm electa (speaking of <b>Italy</b>) quæ cœlum ipsum clarius faceret, sparsa congregaret imperia, ritusque molliret, & tot populorum discordes, ferasque linguas sermonis commercio contraheret ad colloquia, & humanitatem homini daret; breviterque, una cunctarum gentium in toto orbe patria fieret;” lib. ii. cap. 5. Nothing can be stronger to this purpose than the following passage from <b>Tertullian</b>, who lived about the age of <b>Severus</b>. “Certe quidem ipse orbis in promptu est, cultior de die & instructior pristino. Omnia jam pervia, omnia nota, omnia negotiosa. Sol<span class='page-break'>|</span>itudines famosas retro fundi amœnissimi obliteraverunt, silvas arva domuerunt, feras pecora fugaverunt; arenæ seruntur, saxa panguntur, paludes eliquantur, tantæ urbes, quantæ non casæ quondam. Jam nec insulæ horrent, nec scopuli terrent; ubique domus, ubique populus, ubique respublica, ubique vita. Summum testimonium frequentiæ humanæ, onerosi sumus mundo, vix nobis elementa sufficiunt; & necessitates arctiores, et querelæ apud omnes, dum jam nos natura non sustinet.” De anima, cap. 30. The air of rhetoric and declamation which appears in this passage, diminishes somewhat from its authority, but does not entirely destroy it. The same remark may be extended to the following passage of <b>Aristides</b> the sophist, who lived in the age of <b>Adrian</b>. “The whole world,” says he, addressing himself to the <b>Romans</b>, “seems to keep one holiday; and mankind, laying aside the sword which they formerly wore, now betake themselves to feasting and to joy. The cities, forgetting their ancient animosities, preserve only one emulation, which shall embellish itself most by every art and ornament; Theatres every where arise, amphitheatres, porticoes, aqueducts, temples, schools, academies; and one may safely pronounce, that the sinking world has been again raised by your auspicious empire. Nor have cities alone received an encrease of ornament and beauty; but the whole earth, like a garden or paradise, is cultivated and adorned: Insomuch, that such of mankind as are placed out of the limits of your empire (who are but few) seem to merit our sympathy and compassion.”</p>"

Yet we read in <b>Athenæus</b>, (lib. i. cap. 25.) who flourished during the reign of the <b>Antonines</b>, that the town <b>Mareia</b>, near <b>Alexandria</b>, which was formerly a large city, had dwindled into a village. This is not, properly speaking, a contradiction. <b>Suidas</b> (<b>August.</b>) says, that the Emperor <b>Augustus</b>, having numbered the whole <b>Roman</b> empire, found it contained only 4,101,017 men (<i>ανδρες</i>). There is here surely some great mistake, either in the author or transcriber. But this authority, feeble as it is, may be sufficient to counterbalance the exaggerated accounts of <b>Herodotus</b> and <b>Diodorus Siculus</b> with regard to more early times.</p>"

There runs also through the whole an air of superstition and credulity, which resembles very little the spirit that appears in other philosophical compositions of that author.
