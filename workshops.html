    <h2>Recasting the <i>Treatise</i></h2>
    <p>We are organizing a series of workshops with the title "Recasting the <i>Treatise</i>", focusing on the contrasts and differences between Hume's <i>Treatise</i> and his later philosophical works that descended from it. We are planning to hold three workshops, the eventual outcome of which is planned to be a collection of papers to be published by a suitable publisher. The locations, timings, and rough boundaries are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first workshop, to be held in Budapest on the 15th-16th March 2018, will focus on topics from <i>Treatise</i> Book 1, the first <i>Enquiry</i>, and relevant essays.</li>
      <li>The second workshop, provisionally planned to be held in Oxford in September 2018, will be devoted to <i>Treatise</i> Book 2, the <i>Four Dissertations</i> of 1757 (notably the <i>Dissertation on the Passions</i>), and relevant essays.</li>
      <li>The third workshop, provisionally planned to be held in Budapest in the spring of 2019, will be focused on <i>Treatise</i> Book 3, the second <i>Enquiry</i>, and relevant essays.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This structure is not intended to be rigid, and proposals that draw connections between the various themes will also be welcome. Efforts will be made to provide financial support for accommodation and travel for those whose abstracts are accepted, but are unable to cover their costs.</p>
