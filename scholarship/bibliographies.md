## Hume Bibliographies

This section is intended to provide links to useful bibliographic resources on Hume; not mere lists of publications, but helpfully _annotated_ bibliographies. Hume scholars are enthusiastically invited to suggest additions to the page.

### Peter Millican's *Critical Survey of the Literature on Hume and the First Enquiry*

- [*Critical Survey*, First Edition (2000)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link scholarship/ehusurvey.md %})
  
  Please note that a later version of the *Critical Survey* is in Peter Millican (ed.), *Reading Hume on Human Understanding* (Oxford University Press, 2002)
