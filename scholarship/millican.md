## Peter Millican's Papers and Talks on Hume and Early Modern Philosophy

[Peter Millican](http://www.millican.org) is Gilbert Ryle Fellow and Professor of Philosophy at [Hertford College](http://philosophy.hertford.ox.ac.uk/index.htm), [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). He is a member of both the Oxford Faculties of Philosophy and Computer Science. From 1985 until 2005 he lectured in Philosophy and Computing at the [University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk), where he founded the Electronic Text Centre and started the "Leeds Hume Project" from which **davidhume.org** developed. In 2005 he moved to Oxford University, and from 2005 until 2010 he was Co-Editor of the journal [Hume Studies](http://www.humestudies.org).

_(Please note that this page is under continuous development, and makes no claim to completeness. In particular, I have not yet made any attempt to include unpublished talks beyond 2011, though I hope to do so before too long. Some earlier items are listed but not yet included on the website, usually because they have proved hard to track down. For a selection of papers on other topics - e.g. Ethics, Philosophy of Computing, Philosophy of Language, Philosophy of Religion - please go to [PAPERS ON OTHER TOPICS](http://www.millican.org/research.htm).)_

Most of these files are in "PDF" form, to maintain platform independence. Any PowerPoint slides have been reduced to six or twelve per page, and are available in both a colour and a greyscale form (the former for viewing, the latter for printing).
