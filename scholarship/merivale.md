## Amyas Merivale's Papers and Talks on Hume

[Amyas Merivale](http://www.merivale.co.uk/) (known as Henry in person, but also answers to Amyas if you know how to pronounce it) works on the philosophy of language and early modern philosophy. I also have a keen interest in digital humanities, and created this site.
