### "Translations" into Modern English

The eminent philosopher and scholar Jonathan Bennett---at his excellent site [www.earlymoderntexts.com](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com)---has undertaken the translation of several of Hume's texts into modern English. These translations preserve much of the style of the originals, and their argumentative structure, but replace the eighteenth century words and phrases that can cause serious difficulty for non-specialist readers. The complete files are downloadable as PDFs, and can be found here:

_We would be glad to receive suggestions for other high-quality sites to which we might helpfully link. Unfortunately, it seems that many previously useful sites are now no longer functional, or else contain a high proportion of outdated references._
