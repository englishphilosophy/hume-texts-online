## Recasting the *Treatise*

The MTA BTK Lend√ºlet Morals and Science Research Group and Hertford College, Oxford are hosting a workshop entitled

### RECASTING THE TREATISE VOL. II.

This is the second workshop of a series focusing on the contrasts and differences between David Hume&rsquo;s *A Treatise of Human Nature* and his later philosophical works that descended from it. The first workshop was held in Budapest in March 2018, and focused on topics from *Treatise* Book 1, the *Enquiry concerning Human Understanding*, and relevant essays. The second workshop will be held at Hertford College, Oxford, on the 23rd-24th of March 2019.
