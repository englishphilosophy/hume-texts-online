<dhot id="T 3.1.1.1"><para><ac><dc>T</dc>here</ac> is an inconvenience which attends all abstruse reasoning, that it may silence, without convincing an antagonist, and requires the same intense study to <OPB num="2"/>make us sensible of its force, that was at first requisite for its invention. When we leave our closet, and engage in the common affairs of life, its conclusions seem to vanish, like the phantoms of the night on the appearance of the morning; and ’tis difficult for us to retain even that conviction, which we had attain’d with difficulty. This is still more conspicuous in a long chain of reasoning, where we must preserve to the end the evidence of the first propositions, and where we often lose sight of all the most receiv’d maxims, either of philosophy or common life. I am not, however, without hopes, that the present system of philosophy will acquire new force as it advances; and that our reasonings concerning <em>morals</em> will corroborate whatever has been said concerning the <em>understanding</em> and the <em>passions</em>. Morality is a subject that interests us above all others: We fancy the peace of society to be at stake in every decision concerning it; and ’tis evident, that this concern must make our speculations appear more real and solid, than where the subject is, in a great measure, indifferent to us. What affects us, we <MPB ed="SBN" num="456"/>conclude can never be a chimera; and as our passion is engag’d on the one side or the other, we naturally think <OPB num="3"/>that the question lies within human comprehension; which, in other cases of this nature, we are apt to entertain some doubt of. Without this advantage I never should have ventur’d upon a third volume of such abstruse philosophy, in an age, wherein the greatest part of men seem agreed to convert reading into an amusement, and to reject every thing that requires any considerable degree of attention to be comprehended.<br/></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.2"><para><sc>It</sc> has been observ’d, that nothing is ever present to the mind but its perceptions; and that all the actions of seeing, hearing, judging, loving, hating, and thinking, fall under this denomination. The mind can never exert itself in any action, which we may not comprehend under the term of <em>perception</em>; and consequently that term is no less applicable to those judgments, by which we distinguish moral good and evil, than to every other operation of the mind. To approve of one character, to condemn another, are only so many different perceptions.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.3"><para><sc>Now</sc> as perceptions resolve themselves into two kinds, viz. <em>impressions</em> and <em>ideas</em>, this distinction gives rise to a question, with which we shall open up our present enquiry concerning morals, <em>Whether ’tis by means of </em><OPB num="4"/><em>our</em> ideas <em>or</em> impressions <em>we distinguish betwixt vice and virtue, and pronounce an action blameable or praise-worthy?</em>  This will immediately cut off all loose discourses and declamations, and reduce us to something precise and exact on the present subject.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.4"><para><sc>Those</sc> who affirm that virtue is nothing but a conformity to reason; that there are eternal fitnesses and unfitnesses of things, which are the same to every rational being that considers them; that the immutable measures of right and wrong impose an obligation, not only on human creatures, but also on the Deity himself: All these systems concur in the opinion, that morality, like truth, is discern’d merely by <MPB ed="SBN" num="457"/>ideas, and by their juxta-position and comparison. In order, therefore, to judge of these systems, we need only consider, whether it be possible, from reason alone, to distinguish betwixt moral good and evil, or whether there must concur some other principles to enable us to make that distinction.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.5"><para><sc>If</sc> morality had naturally no influence on human passions and actions, ’twere in vain to take such pains to inculcate it; and nothing wou’d be more fruitless than that multitude of rules and precepts, with which all moralists abound. Philosophy is commonly <OPB num="5"/>divided into <em>speculative</em> and <em>practical</em>; and as morality is always comprehended under the latter division, ’tis supposed to influence our passions and actions, and to go beyond the calm and indolent judgments of the understanding. And this is confirm’d by common experience, which informs us, that men are often govern’d by their duties, and are deter’d from some actions by the opinion of injustice, and impell’d to others by that of obligation.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.6"><para><sc>Since</sc> morals, therefore, have an influence on the actions and affections, it follows, that they cannot be deriv’d from reason; and that because reason alone, as we have already prov’d, can never have any such influence. Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.7"><para><sc>No</sc> one, I believe, will deny the justness of this inference; nor is there any other means of evading it, than by denying that principle, on which it is founded. As long as it is allow’d, that reason has no influence on our passions and actions, ’tis in vain to pretend, that morality is discover’d only by a deduction of reason. An active principle <OPB num="6"/>can never be founded on an inactive; and if reason be inactive in itself, it must remain so in all its shapes and appearances, whether it exerts itself in natural or moral subjects, whether it considers the powers of external bodies, or the actions of rational beings.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.8"><para><sc>It</sc> would be tedious to repeat all the arguments, by which <MPB ed="SBN" num="458"/>I have prov’d,<footnote num="67" sym="a"/> that reason is perfectly inert, and can never either prevent or produce any action or affection. ’Twill be easy to recollect what has been said upon that subject. I shall only recal on this occasion one of these arguments, which I shall endeavour to render still more conclusive, and more applicable to the present subject.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.9"><para><sc>Reason</sc> is the discovery of truth or falshood. Truth or falshood consists in an agreement or disagreement either to the <em>real</em> relations of ideas, or to <em>real</em> existence and matter of fact. Whatever, therefore, is not susceptible of this agreement or disagreement, is incapable of being true or false, and can never be an object of our reason. Now ’tis evident our passions, volitions, and actions, are not susceptible of any such agreement or disagreement; being original facts and realities, compleat in themselves, and implying <OPB num="7"/>no reference to other passions, volitions, and actions. ’Tis impossible, therefore, they can be pronounced either true or false, and be either contrary or conformable to reason.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.10"><para><sc>This</sc> argument is of double advantage to our present purpose. For it proves <em>directly</em>, that actions do not derive their merit from a conformity to reason, nor their blame from a contrariety to it; and it proves the same truth more <em>indirectly</em>, by shewing us, that as reason can never immediately prevent or produce any action by contradicting or approving of it, it cannot be the source of <ins comment="manuscript addition">the distinction betwixt</ins> moral good and evil, which are found to have that influence. Actions may be laudable or blameable; but they cannot be reasonable or unreasonable: Laudable or blameable, therefore, are not the same with reasonable or unreasonable. The merit and demerit of actions frequently contradict, and sometimes controul our natural propensities. But reason has no such influence. Moral distinctions, therefore, are not the offspring of reason. Reason is wholly inactive, and can never be the source of so active a principle as conscience, or a sense of morals.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.11"><MPB ed="SBN" num="459"/><para><sc>But</sc> perhaps it may be said, that tho’ no will or action can be immediately contradictory to reason, yet we may find such a <OPB num="8"/>contradiction in some of the attendants of the action, that is, in its causes or effects. The action may cause a judgment, or may be <em>obliquely</em> caus’d by one, when the judgment concurs with a passion; and by an abusive way of speaking, which philosophy will scarce allow of, the same contrariety may, upon that account, be ascrib’d to the action. How far this truth or falshood may be the source of morals, ’twill now be proper to consider.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.12"><para><sc>It</sc> has been observ’d, that reason, in a strict and philosophical sense, can have an influence on our conduct only after two ways: Either when it excites a passion by informing us of the existence of something which is a proper object of it; or when it discovers the connexion of causes and effects, so as to afford us means of exerting any passion. These are the only kinds of judgment, which can accompany our actions, or can be said to produce them in any manner; and it must be allow’d, that these judgments may often be false and erroneous. A person may be affected with passion, by supposing a pain or pleasure to lie in an object, which has no tendency to produce either of these sensations, or which produces the contrary to what is imagin’d. A person may also <OPB num="9"/>take false measures for the attaining his end, and may retard, by his foolish conduct, instead of forwarding the execution of any project. These false judgments may be thought to affect the passions and actions, which are connected with them, and may be said to render them unreasonable, in a figurative and improper way of speaking. But tho’ this be acknowledg’d, ’tis easy to observe, that these errors are so far from being the source of all immorality, that they are commonly very innocent, and draw no manner of guilt upon the person who is so unfortunate as to fall into them. They extend not beyond a mistake of <em>fact</em>, which moralists have not generally suppos’d criminal, as being perfectly involuntary. I am more to be lamented than blam’d, if I <MPB ed="SBN" num="460"/>am mistaken with regard to the influence of objects in producing pain or pleasure, or if I know not the proper means of satisfying my desires. No one can ever regard such errors as a defect in my moral character. A fruit, for instance, that is really disagreeable, appears to me at a distance, and thro’ mistake I fancy it to be pleasant and delicious. Here is one error. I choose certain means of reaching this fruit, which are not proper for my end. Here is a second error; nor is there <OPB num="10"/>any third one, which can ever possibly enter into our reasonings concerning actions. I ask, therefore, if a man, in this situation, and guilty of these two errors, is to be regarded as vicious and criminal, however unavoidable they might have been? Or if it be possible to imagine, that such errors are the sources of all immorality?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.13"><para><sc>And</sc> here it may be proper to observe, that if moral distinctions be deriv’d from the truth or falshood of those judgments, they must take place wherever we form the judgments; nor will there be any difference, whether the question be concerning an apple or a kingdom, or whether the error be avoidable or unavoidable. For as the very essence of morality is suppos’d to consist in an agreement or disagreement to reason, the other circumstances are entirely arbitrary, and can never either bestow on any action the character of virtuous or vicious, or deprive it of that character. To which we may add, that this agreement or disagreement, not admitting of degrees, all virtues and vices wou’d of course be equal.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.14"><para><sc>Shou</sc>’<sc>d</sc> it be pretended, that tho’ a mistake of <em>fact</em> be not criminal, yet a mistake of <em>right</em> often is; and that this may be the source of immorality: I would answer, that <OPB num="11"/>’tis impossible such a mistake can ever be the original source of immorality, since it supposes a real right and wrong; that is, a real distinction in morals, independent of these judgments. A mistake, therefore, of right may become a species of immorality; but ’tis only a secondary one, and is founded on some other, antecedent to it.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.15"><MPB ed="SBN" num="461"/><para><sc>As</sc> to those judgments which are the <em>effects</em> of our actions, and which, when false, give occasion to pronounce the actions contrary to truth and reason; we may observe, that our actions never cause any judgment, either true or false, in ourselves, and that ’tis only on others they have such an influence. ’Tis certain, that an action, on many occasions, may give rise to false conclusions in others; and that a person, who thro’ a window sees any lewd behaviour of mine with my neighbour’s wife, may be so simple as to imagine she is certainly my own. In this respect my action resembles somewhat a lye or falshood; only with this difference, which is material, that I perform not the action with any intention of giving rise to a false judgment in another, but merely to satisfy my lust and passion. It causes, however, a mistake and false judgment by accident; and the falshood of its effects may be ascribed, <OPB num="12"/>by some odd figurative way of speaking, to the action itself. But still I can see no pretext of reason for asserting, that the tendency to cause such an error is the first spring or original source of all immorality<footnote num="68" sym="a"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.16"><para><sc>Thus</sc> upon the whole, ’tis impossible, that the distinction betwixt moral good and evil, <OPB num="13"/>can be made by reason; since that distinction has an influence upon our actions, of which reason alone is incapable. Reason and judgment may, indeed, be the mediate cause of an action, by prompting, or by directing a <OPB num="14"/>passion: But it is not pretended, that a judgment of this kind, either in its truth or falshood, is attended with virtue or vice. And as to the judgments, which are <MPB ed="SBN" num="463"/>caused by our <del>judgments</del><ins comment="originally 'judgments'; evidently an error, and from the context it is clear that 'actions' is what was intended">actions</ins>, they can still less bestow those moral qualities on the actions, which are their causes.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.17"><para><sc>But</sc> to be more particular, and to shew, that those eternal immutable fitnesses and unfitnesses of things cannot be defended by sound philosophy, we may weigh the following considerations.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.18"><para><sc>If</sc> the thought and understanding were alone capable of fixing the boundaries of right and wrong, the character of virtuous and vicious either must lie in some relations of objects, or must be a matter of fact, which is discovered by our reasoning. This consequence is evident. As the operations of human understanding divide themselves into two kinds, the comparing of ideas, and the inferring of matter of fact; were virtue discover’d by the understanding; it must be an object of one of these operations, nor is there any third operation of the understanding, which can discover it. There has been an opinion very industriously propagated by certain philosophers, that morality is susceptible of demonstration; and tho’ no one has <OPB num="15"/>ever been able to advance a single step in those demonstrations; yet ’tis taken for granted, that this science may be brought to an equal certainty with geometry or algebra. Upon this supposition, vice and virtue must consist in some relations; since ’tis allow’d on all hands, that no matter of fact is capable of being demonstrated. Let us, therefore, begin with examining this hypothesis, and endeavour, if possible, to fix those moral qualities, which have been so long the objects of our fruitless researches. Point out distinctly the relations, which constitute morality or obligation, that we may know wherein they consist, and after what manner we must judge of them.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.19"><para><sc>If</sc> you assert, that vice and virtue consist in relations susceptible of certainty and demonstration, you must confine yourself to those <em>four</em> relations, which alone admit of that degree of evidence; and in that case you run into absurdities, from which you will never be able to extricate yourself. For as you make the very essence of morality to lie in the <MPB ed="SBN" num="464"/>relations, and as there is no one of these relations but what is applicable, not only to an irrational, but also to an inanimate object; it follows, that even such objects must be susceptible of merit or demerit. <OPB num="16"/><em>Resemblance</em>, <em>contrariety</em>, <em>degrees in quality</em>, and <em>proportions in quantity and number</em>; all these relations belong as properly to matter, as to our actions, passions, and volitions. ’Tis unquestionable, therefore, that morality lies not in any of these relations, nor the sense of it in their discovery<footnote num="69" sym="b"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.20"><para><sc>Shou</sc>’<sc>d</sc> it be asserted, that the sense of morality consists in the discovery of some relation, distinct from these, and that our enumeration was not compleat, when we comprehended all demonstrable relations under four general heads: To this I know not what to reply, till some one be so good as to point out to me this new relation. ’Tis impossible to refute a system, which has ne<OPB num="17"/>ver yet been explain’d. In such a manner of fighting in the dark, a man loses his blows in the air, and often places them where the enemy is not present.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.21"><para><sc>I must</sc>, therefore, on this occasion, rest contented with requiring the two following conditions of any one that wou’d undertake to clear up this system. <em>First</em>, As moral good and evil belong only to the actions of the mind, and are deriv’d from our situation with regard to external objects, the relations, from which these moral distinctions arise, must lie <MPB ed="SBN" num="465"/>only betwixt internal actions, and external objects, and must not be applicable either to internal actions, compared among themselves, or to external objects, when placed in opposition to other external objects. For as morality is supposed to attend certain relations, if these relations cou’d belong to internal actions consider’d singly, it wou’d follow, that we might be guilty of crimes in ourselves, and independent of our situation, with respect to the universe: And in like manner, if these moral relations cou’d be apply’d to external objects, it wou’d follow, that even inanimate beings wou’d be susceptible of moral beauty and deformity. Now it seems difficult to imagine, that any relation can be discover’d betwixt our pas<OPB num="18"/>sions, volitions and actions, compared to external objects, which relation might not belong either to these passions and volitions, or to these external objects, compar’d among <em>themselves</em>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.22"><para><sc>But</sc> it will be still more difficult to fulfil the <em>second</em> condition, requisite to justify this system. According to the principles of those who maintain an abstract rational difference betwixt moral good and evil, and a natural fitness and unfitness of things, ’tis not only suppos’d, that these relations, being eternal and immutable, are the same, when consider’d by every rational creature, but their <em>effects</em> are also suppos’d to be necessarily the same; and ’tis concluded they have no less, or rather a greater, influence in directing the will of the deity, than in governing the rational and virtuous of our own species. These two particulars are evidently distinct. ’Tis one thing to know virtue, and another to conform the will to it. In order, therefore, to prove, that the measures of right and wrong are eternal laws, <em>obligatory</em> on every rational mind, ’tis not sufficient to shew the relations upon which they are founded: We must also point out the connexion betwixt the relation and the will; and must prove that this connexion is so <OPB num="19"/>necessary, that in every well-disposed mind, it must take place and have its influence; tho’ the difference betwixt these minds be in other respects immense and infinite. Now <MPB ed="SBN" num="466"/>besides what I have already prov’d, that even in human nature no relation can ever alone produce any action; besides this, I say, it has been shewn, in treating of the understanding, that there is no connexion of cause and effect, such as this is suppos’d to be, which is discoverable otherwise than by experience, and of which we can pretend to have any security by the simple consideration of the objects. All beings in the universe, consider’d in themselves, appear entirely loose and independent of each other. ’Tis only by experience we learn their influence and connexion; and this influence we ought never to extend beyond experience.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.23"><para><sc>Thus</sc> it will be impossible to fulfil the <em>first</em> condition required to the system of eternal rational measures of right and wrong; because it is impossible to shew those relations, upon which such a distinction may be founded: And ’tis as impossible to fulfil the <em>second</em> condition; because we cannot prove <em>a priori</em>, that these relations, if they really existed and were perceiv’d, wou’d be universally forcible and obligatory.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.24"><para><sc>But</sc> to make these general reflections more clear and convincing, we may illustrate them by some particular instances, wherein this character of moral good or evil is the most universally acknowledged. Of all crimes that human creatures are capable of committing, the most horrid and unnatural is ingratitude, especially when it is committed against parents, and appears in the more flagrant instances of wounds and death. This is acknowledg’d by all mankind, philosophers as well as the people; the question only arises among philosophers, whether the guilt or moral deformity of this action be discover’d by demonstrative reasoning, or be felt by an internal sense, and by means of some sentiment, which the reflecting on such an action naturally occasions. This question will soon be decided against the former opinion, if we can shew the same relations in other objects, without the notion of any guilt or iniquity attending them. Reason or science is nothing but the comparing of ideas, and the discovery of their relations; and if the same relations <MPB ed="SBN" num="467"/>have different characters, it must evidently follow, that those characters are not discover’d merely by reason. To put the affair, therefore, to this trial, let us chuse any inanimate object, <OPB num="21"/>such as an oak or elm; and let us suppose, that by the dropping of its seed, it produces a sapling below it, which springing up by degrees, at last overtops and destroys the parent tree: I ask, if in this instance there be wanting any relation, which is discoverable in parricide or ingratitude? Is not the one tree the cause of the other’s existence; and the latter the cause of the destruction of the former, in the same manner as when a child murders his parent? ’Tis not sufficient to reply, that a choice or will is wanting. For in the case of parricide, a will does not give rise to any <em>different</em> relations, but is only the cause from which the action is deriv’d; and consequently produces the <em>same</em> relations, that in the oak or elm arise from some other principles. ’Tis a will or choice, that determines a man to kill his parent; and they are the laws of matter and motion, that determine a sapling to destroy the oak, from which it sprung. Here then the same relations have different causes; but still the relations are the same: And as their discovery is not in both cases attended with a notion of immorality, it follows, that that notion does not arise from such a discovery.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.25"><para><sc>But</sc> to chuse an instance, still more resembling; I would fain ask any one, why incest in the human species is criminal, and why the very same action, and the same relations in animals have not the smallest moral turpitude and deformity? If it be answer’d, that this action is innocent in animals, because they have not reason sufficient to discover its turpitude; but that man, being endow’d with that faculty, which <em>ought</em> to restrain him to his duty, the same action instantly becomes criminal to him; should this be said, I would reply, that this is evidently arguing in a circle. For before reason can perceive this turpitude, the turpitude must exist; and consequently is independent of the decisions of our reason, and is their object more properly than their effect. Ac<MPB ed="SBN" num="468"/>cording to this system, then, every animal, that has sense, and appetite, and will; that is, every animal must be susceptible of all the same virtues and vices, for which we ascribe praise and blame to human creatures. All the difference is, that our superior reason may serve to discover the vice or virtue, and by that means may augment the blame or praise: But still this discovery supposes a separate being in these moral distinctions, and a being, which depends only on the <OPB num="23"/>will and appetite, and which, both in thought and reality, may be distinguish’d from the reason. Animals are susceptible of the same relations, with respect to each other, as the human species, and therefore wou’d also be susceptible of the same morality, if the essence of morality consisted in these relations. Their want of a sufficient degree of reason may hinder them from perceiving the duties and obligations of morality, but can never hinder these duties from existing; since they must antecedently exist, in order to their being perceiv’d. Reason must find them, and can never produce them. This argument deserves to be weigh’d, as being, in my opinion, entirely decisive.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.26"><para><sc>Nor</sc> does this reasoning only prove, that morality consists not in any relations, that are the objects of science; but if examin’d, will prove with equal certainty, that it consists not in any <em>matter of fact</em>, which can be discover’d by the understanding. This is the <em>second</em> part of our argument; and if it can be made evident, we may conclude, that morality is not an object of reason. But can there be any difficulty in proving, that vice and virtue are not matters of fact, whose existence we can infer by reason? Take any action allow’d to be vicious: Wil<OPB num="24"/>ful murder, for instance. Examine it in all lights, and see if you can find that matter of fact, or real existence, which you call <em>vice</em>. In which-ever way you take it, you find only certain passions, motives, volitions and thoughts. There is no other matter of fact in the case. The vice entirely escapes you, as long as you consider the object. You never can find it, till you turn your reflection into your <MPB ed="SBN" num="469"/>own breast, and find a sentiment of disapprobation, which arises in you, towards this action. Here is a matter of fact; but ’tis the object of feeling, not of reason. It lies in yourself, not in the object. So that when you pronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean nothing, but that from the constitution of your nature you have a feeling or sentiment of blame from the contemplation of it. Vice and virtue, therefore, may be compar’d to sounds, colours, heat and cold, which, according to modern philosophy, are not qualities in objects, but perceptions in the mind: And this discovery in morals, like that other in physics, is to be regarded as a considerable advancement of the speculative sciences; tho’, like that too, it has little or no influence on practice. Nothing can be more real, or concern us more, than our <OPB num="25"/>own sentiments of pleasure and uneasiness; and if these be favourable to virtue, and unfavourable to vice, no more can be requisite to the regulation of our conduct and behaviour.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.1.27"><para><sc>I</sc> cannot forbear adding to these reasonings an observation, which may, perhaps, be found of some importance. In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remark’d, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surpriz’d to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, <em>is</em>, and <em>is not</em>, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an <em>ought</em>, or an <em>ought not</em>. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this <em>ought</em>, or <em>ought not</em>, expresses some new relation or affirmation, ’tis necessary that it shou’d be observ’d and explain’d; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; <OPB num="26"/>and am persuaded, <MPB ed="SBN" num="470"/>that this small attention wou’d subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceiv’d by reason.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.2"><title><h3><wide>SEC</wide>T.<wide> </wide>II.</h3><h4><em>Moral distinctions deriv’d from a moral sense.</em></h4></title></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.2.1"><para><ac><dc>T</dc>hus</ac> the course of the argument leads us to conclude, that since vice and virtue are not discoverable merely by reason, or the comparison of ideas, it must be by means of some impression or sentiment they occasion, that we are able to mark the difference betwixt them. Our decisions concerning moral rectitude and depravity are evidently perceptions; and as all perceptions are either impressions or ideas, the exclusion of the one is a convincing argument for the other. Morality, therefore, is more properly felt than judg’d of; tho’ this feeling or sentiment is commonly so soft and gentle, that we are apt to confound it with an idea, according to our com<OPB num="27"/>mon custom of taking all things for the same, which have any near resemblance to each other.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.2.2"><para><sc>The</sc> next question is, Of what nature are these impressions, and after what manner do they operate upon us? Here we cannot remain long in suspense, but must pronounce the impression arising from virtue, to be agreeable, and that proceding from vice to be uneasy. Every moment’s experience must convince us of this. There is no spectacle so fair and beautiful as a noble and generous action; nor any which gives us more abhorrence than one that is cruel and treacherous. No enjoyment equals the satisfaction we receive from the company of those we love and esteem; as the greatest of all punishments is to be oblig’d to pass our lives with those we hate or contemn. A very play or romance may afford us instances of this <MPB ed="SBN" num="471"/>pleasure, which virtue conveys to us; and pain, which arises from vice.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.2.3"><para><sc>Now</sc> since the distinguishing impressions, by which moral good or evil is known, are nothing but <em>particular</em> pains or pleasures; it follows, that in all enquiries concerning these moral distinctions, it will be sufficient to shew the principles, which make us feel a satisfaction or uneasiness from the survey of any <OPB num="28"/>character, in order to satisfy us why the character is laudable or blameable. An action, or sentiment, or character is virtuous or vicious; why? because its view causes a pleasure or uneasiness of a particular kind. In giving a reason, therefore, for the pleasure or uneasiness, we sufficiently explain the vice or virtue. To have the sense of virtue, is nothing but to <em>feel</em> a satisfaction of a particular kind from the contemplation of a character. The very <em>feeling</em> constitutes our praise or admiration. We go no farther; nor do we enquire into the cause of the satisfaction. We do not infer a character to be virtuous, because it pleases: But in feeling that it pleases after such a particular manner, we in effect feel that it is virtuous. The case is the same as in our judgments concerning all kinds of beauty, and tastes, and sensations. Our approbation is imply’d in the immediate pleasure they convey to us.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.2.4"><para><sc>I have</sc> objected to the system, which establishes eternal rational measures of right and wrong, that ’tis impossible to shew, in the actions of reasonable creatures, any relations, which are not found in external objects; and therefore, if morality always attended these relations, ’twere possible for inanimate matter to become virtuous or vi<OPB num="29"/>cious. Now it may, in like manner, be objected to the present system, that if virtue and vice be determin’d by pleasure and pain, these qualities must, in every case, arise from the sensations; and consequently any object, whether animate or inanimate, rational or irrational, might become morally good or evil, provided it can excite a satisfaction or uneasiness. But tho’ this objection seems to be the very same, <MPB ed="SBN" num="472"/>it has by no means the same force, in the one case as in the other. For, <em>first</em>, ’tis evident, that under the term <em>pleasure</em>, we comprehend sensations, which are very different from each other, and which have only such a distant resemblance, as is requisite to make them be express’d by the same abstract term. A good composition of music and a bottle of good wine equally produce pleasure; and what is more, their goodness is determin’d merely by the pleasure. But shall we say upon that account, that the wine is harmonious, or the music of a good flavour? In like manner an inanimate object, and the character or sentiments of any person may, both of them, give satisfaction; but as the satisfaction is different, this keeps our sentiments concerning them from being confounded, and makes us ascribe virtue to the one, and not to the other. <OPB num="30"/>Nor is every sentiment of pleasure or pain, which arises from characters and actions, of that <em>peculiar</em> kind, which makes us praise or condemn. The good qualities of an enemy are hurtful to us; but may still command our esteem and respect. ’Tis only when a character is considered in general, without reference to our particular interest, that it causes such a feeling or sentiment, as denominates it morally good or evil. ’Tis true, those sentiments, from interest and morals, are apt to be confounded, and naturally run into one another. It seldom happens, that we do not think an enemy vicious, and can distinguish betwixt his opposition to our interest and real villainy or baseness. But this hinders not, but that the sentiments are, in themselves, distinct; and a man of temper and judgment may preserve himself from these illusions. In like manner, tho’ ’tis certain a musical voice is nothing but one that naturally gives a <em>particular</em> kind of pleasure; yet ’tis difficult for a man to be sensible, that the voice of an enemy is agreeable, or to allow it to be musical. But a person of a fine ear, who has the command of himself, can separate these feelings, and give praise to what deserves it.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.2.5"><MPB ed="SBN" num="473"/><para><em>Secondly,</em> We may call to remembrance the preceding system of the passions, in order to remark a still more considerable difference among our pains and pleasures. Pride and humility, love and hatred are excited, when there is any thing presented to us, that both bears a relation to the object of the passion, and produces a separate sensation related to the sensation of the passion. Now virtue and vice are attended with these circumstances. They must necessarily be plac’d either in ourselves or others, and excite either pleasure or uneasiness; and therefore must give rise to one of these four passions; which clearly distinguishes them from the pleasure and pain arising from inanimate objects, that often bear no relation to us: And this is, perhaps, the most considerable effect that virtue and vice have upon the human mind.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.2.6"><para><sc>It</sc> may now be ask’d <em>in general</em>, concerning this pain or pleasure, that distinguishes moral good and evil, <em>From what principles is it derived, and whence does it arise in the human mind?</em>  To this I reply, <em>first</em>, that ’tis absurd to imagine, that in every particular instance, these sentiments are produc’d by an <em>original</em> quality and <em>primary</em> constitution. For as the number of <OPB num="32"/>our duties is, in a manner, infinite, ’tis impossible that our original instincts should extend to each of them, and from our very first infancy impress on the human mind all that multitude of precepts, which are contain’d in the compleatest system of ethics. Such a method of proceeding is not conformable to the usual maxims, by which nature is conducted, where a few principles produce all that variety we observe in the universe, and every thing is carry’d on in the easiest and most simple manner. ’Tis necessary, therefore, to abridge these primary impulses, and find some more general principles, upon which all our notions of morals are founded.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.2.7"><para><sc>But</sc> in the <em>second</em> place, should it be ask’d, Whether we ought to search for these principles in <em>nature</em>, or whether we must look for them in some other origin? I wou’d <MPB ed="SBN" num="474"/>reply, that our answer to this question depends upon the definition of the word, Nature, than which there is none more ambiguous and equivocal. If <em>nature</em> be oppos’d to miracles, not only the distinction betwixt vice and virtue is natural, but also every event, which has ever happen’d in the world, <em>excepting those miracles, on which our religion is founded</em>. In saying, then, that the senti<OPB num="33"/>ments of vice and virtue are natural in this sense, we make no very extraordinary discovery.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.2.8"><para><sc>But</sc> <em>nature</em> may also be opposed to rare and unusual; and in this sense of the word, which is the common one, there may often arise disputes concerning what is natural or unnatural; and one may in general affirm, that we are not possess’d of any very precise standard, by which these disputes can be decided. Frequent and rare depend upon the number of examples we have observ’d; and as this number may gradually encrease or diminish, ’twill be impossible to fix any exact boundaries betwixt them. We may only affirm on this head, that if ever there was any thing, which cou’d be call’d natural in this sense, the sentiments of morality certainly may; since there never was any nation of the world, nor any single person in any nation, who was utterly depriv’d of them, and who never, in any instance, shew’d the least approbation or dislike of manners. These sentiments are so rooted in our constitution and temper, that without entirely confounding the human mind by disease or madness, ’tis impossible to extirpate and destroy them.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.2.9"><para><sc>But</sc> <em>nature</em> may also be opposed to artifice, as well as to what is rare and unu<OPB num="34"/>sual; and in this sense it may be disputed, whether the notions of virtue be natural or not. We readily forget, that the designs, and projects, and views of men are principles as necessary in their operation as heat and cold, moist and dry: But taking them to be free and entirely our own, ’tis usual for us to set them in opposition to the other principles of nature. Shou’d it, therefore, be demanded, <MPB ed="SBN" num="475"/>whether the sense of virtue be natural or artificial, I am of opinion, that ’tis impossible for me at present to give any precise answer to this question. Perhaps it will appear afterwards, that our sense of some virtues is artificial, and that of others natural. The discussion of this question will be more proper, when we enter upon an exact detail of each particular vice and virtue<footnote num="70" sym="a"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.2.10"><para><sc>Mean</sc> while it may not be amiss to observe from these definitions of <em>natural</em> and <em>unnatural</em>, that nothing can be more unphilosophical than those systems, which assert, that virtue is the same with what is natural, and vice with what is unnatural. For in the first sense of the word, Nature, as opposed to miracles, both vice and virtue are equally natural; and in the second sense, as oppos’d to <OPB num="35"/>what is unusual, perhaps virtue will be found to be the most unnatural. At least it must be own’d, that heroic virtue, being as unusual, is as little natural as the most brutal barbarity. As to the third sense of the word, ’tis certain, that both vice and virtue are equally artificial, and out of nature. For however it may be disputed, whether the notion of a merit or demerit in certain actions be natural or artificial, ’tis evident, that the actions themselves are artificial, and are perform’d with a certain design and intention; otherwise they cou’d never be rank’d under any of these denominations. ’Tis impossible, therefore, that the character of natural and unnatural can ever, in any sense, mark the boundaries of vice and virtue.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.1.2.11"><para><sc>Thus</sc> we are still brought back to our first position, that virtue is distinguished by the pleasure, and vice by the pain, that any action, sentiment or character gives us by the mere view and contemplation. This decision is very commodious; because it reduces us to this simple question, <em>Why any action or sentiment upon the general view or survey, gives a certain satisfaction or uneasiness</em>, in order to shew the origin <MPB ed="SBN" num="476"/>of its moral rectitude or depravity, without looking for any incomprehensible relations and qua<OPB num="36"/>lities, which never did exist in nature, nor even in our imagination, by any clear and distinct conception. I flatter myself I have executed a great part of my present design by a state of the question, which appears to me so free from ambiguity and obscurity.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="T 3.2.1.1"><para><ac><dc>I</dc> have</ac> already hinted, that our sense of every kind of virtue is not natural; but that there are some virtues, that produce pleasure and approbation by means of an artifice or contrivance, which arises from the circumstances and <del>necessity</del><ins comment="originally 'necessity'; manuscript alteration">necessities</ins> of mankind. Of this kind I assert <em>justice</em> to be; and shall endeavour to defend this opinion by a short, and, I hope, convincing argument, before I examine the nature of the artifice, from which the sense of that virtue is derived.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.2"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> evident, that when we praise any actions, we regard only the motives that produced them, and consider the actions as signs or indications of certain principles in the mind and temper. The external performance has no merit. We must look within to find the moral quality. This we cannot do directly; and therefore fix our attention on actions, as on external signs. But these actions are still considered as signs; and the ultimate object of our praise and approbation is the motive, that produc’d them.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.3"><para><sc>After</sc> the same manner, when we require any action, or blame a person for not performing it, we always suppose, that one in that situation shou’d be influenc’d by the proper motive of that action, and we esteem it vicious in him to be regardless of it. If we find, upon enquiry, that the virtuous motive was still powerful over his breast, tho’ check’d in its operation by some circumstances unknown to us, we retract <MPB ed="SBN" num="478"/>our blame, and have the same esteem for him, as if he had actually perform’d the action, which we require of him.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.4"><para><sc>It</sc> appears, therefore, that all virtuous actions derive their merit only from virtuous motives, and are consider’d merely as signs <OPB num="39"/>of those motives. From this principle I conclude, that the first virtuous motive, which bestows a merit on any action, can never be a regard to the virtue of that action, but must be some other natural motive or principle. To suppose, that the mere regard to the virtue of the action, may be the first motive, which produc’d the action, and render’d it virtuous, is to reason in a circle. Before we can have such a regard, the action must be really virtuous; and this virtue must be deriv’d from some virtuous motive: And consequently the virtuous motive must be different from the regard to the virtue of the action. A virtuous motive is requisite to render an action virtuous. An action must be virtuous, before we can have a regard to its virtue. Some virtuous motive, therefore, must be antecedent to that regard.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.5"><para><sc>Nor</sc> is this merely a metaphysical subtilty; but enters into all our reasonings in common life, tho’ perhaps we may not be able to place it in such distinct philosophical terms. We blame a father for neglecting his child. Why? because it shews a want of natural affection, which is the duty of every parent. Were not natural affection a duty, the care of children cou’d not be a duty; and ’twere impossible we cou’d have the duty <OPB num="40"/>in our eye in the attention we give to our offspring. In this case, therefore, all men suppose a motive to the action distinct from a sense of duty.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.6"><para><sc>Here</sc> is a man, that does many benevolent actions; relieves the distress’d, comforts the afflicted, and extends his bounty even to the greatest strangers. No character can be more amiable and virtuous. We regard these actions as proofs of the greatest humanity. This humanity bestows a merit on the actions. A regard to this merit is, therefore, a secondary consideration, and deriv’d from the antecedent <del>principles</del><ins comment="originally 'principles'; ERRATA change">principle</ins> of humanity, which is meritorious and laudable.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.7"><MPB ed="SBN" num="479"/><para><sc>In</sc> short, it may be establish’d as an undoubted maxim, <em>that no action can be virtuous, or morally good, unless there be in human nature some motive to produce it, distinct from the sense of its morality</em>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.8"><para><sc>But</sc> may not the sense of morality or duty produce an action, without any other motive? I answer, It may: But this is no objection to the present doctrine. When any virtuous motive or principle is common in human nature, a person, who feels his heart devoid of that <del>motive</del><ins comment="originally 'motive'; manuscript alteration">principle</ins>, may hate himself upon that account, and may perform the action without the motive, from a cer<OPB num="41"/>tain sense of duty, in order to acquire by practice, that virtuous principle, or at least, to disguise to himself, as much as possible, his want of it. A man that really feels no gratitude in his temper, is still pleas’d to perform grateful actions, and thinks he has, by that means, fulfill’d his duty. Actions are at first only consider’d as signs of motives: But ’tis usual, in this case, as in all others, to fix our attention on the signs, and neglect, in some measure, the thing signify’d. But tho’, on some occasions, a person may perform an action merely out of regard to its moral obligation, yet still this supposes in human nature some distinct principles, which are capable of producing the action, and whose moral beauty renders the action meritorious.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.9"><para><sc>Now</sc> to apply all this to the present case; I suppose a person to have lent me a sum of money, on condition that it be restor’d in a few days; and also suppose, that after the expiration of the term agreed on, he demands the sum: I ask, <em>What reason or motive have I to restore the money?</em> It will, perhaps, be said, that my regard to justice, and abhorrence of villainy and knavery, are sufficient reasons for me, if I have the least grain of honesty, or sense of duty and obli<OPB num="42"/>gation. And this answer, no doubt, is just and satisfactory to man in his civiliz’d state, and when train’d up according to a certain discipline and education. But in his rude and more <em>natural</em> condition, if you are pleas’d to call such a condition natural, this answer wou’d be rejected as perfectly <MPB ed="SBN" num="480"/>unintelligible and sophistical. For one in that situation wou’d immediately ask you, <em>Wherein consists this honesty and justice, which you find in restoring a loan, and abstaining from the property of others?</em>  It does not surely lie in the external action. It must, therefore<ins comment="there is no comma in the original, but the sense clearly requires one">,</ins> be plac’d in the motive, from which the external action is deriv’d. This motive can never be a regard to the honesty of the action. For ’tis a plain fallacy to say, that a virtuous motive is requisite to render an action honest, and at the same time that a regard to the honesty is the motive of the action. We can never have a regard to the virtue of an action, unless the action be antecedently virtuous. No action can be virtuous, but so far as it proceeds from a virtuous motive. A virtuous motive, therefore, must precede the regard to the virtue; and ’tis impossible, that the virtuous motive and the regard to the virtue can be the same.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.10"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> requisite, then, to find some motive to acts of justice and honesty, distinct from our regard to the honesty; and in this lies the great difficulty. For shou’d we say, that a concern for our private interest or reputation is the legitimate motive to all honest actions; it wou’d follow, that wherever that concern ceases, honesty can no longer have place. But ’tis certain, that self-love, when it acts at its liberty, instead of engaging us to honest actions, is the source of all injustice and violence; nor can a man ever correct those vices, without correcting and restraining the <em>natural</em> movements of that appetite.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.11"><para><sc>But</sc> shou’d it be affirm’d, that the reason or motive of such actions is the <em>regard to publick interest</em>, to which nothing is more contrary than examples of injustice and dishonesty; shou’d this be said, I wou’d propose the three following considerations, as worthy of our attention. <em>First</em>, public interest is not naturally attach’d to the observation of the rules of justice; but is only connected with it, after an artificial convention for the establishment of these rules, as shall be shewn more at large hereafter. <em>Secondly</em>, if we suppose, that the <MPB ed="SBN" num="481"/>loan was secret, and that it is necessary for the interest of <OPB num="44"/>the person, that the money be restor’d in the same manner (as when the lender wou’d conceal his riches) in that case the example ceases, and the public is no longer interested in the actions of the borrower; tho’ I suppose there is no moralist, who will affirm, that the duty and obligation ceases. <em>Thirdly</em>, experience sufficiently proves, that men, in the ordinary conduct of life, look not so far as the public interest, when they pay their creditors, perform their promises, and abstain from theft, and robbery, and injustice of every kind. That is a motive too remote and too sublime to affect the generality of mankind, and operate with any force in actions so contrary to private interest as are frequently those of justice and common honesty.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.12"><para><sc>In</sc> general, it may be affirm’d, that there is no such passion in human minds, as the love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal qualities, of services, or of relation to ourself. ’Tis true, there is no human, and indeed no sensible, creature, whose happiness or misery does not, in some measure, affect us, when brought near to us, and represented in lively colours: But this proceeds merely from sympathy, and is no proof of such an universal affection to man<OPB num="45"/>kind, since this concern extends itself beyond our own species. An affection betwixt the sexes is a passion evidently implanted in human nature; and this passion not only appears in its peculiar symptoms, but also in inflaming every other principle of affection, and raising a stronger love from beauty, wit, kindness, than what wou’d otherwise flow from them. Were there an universal love among all human creatures, it wou’d appear after the same manner. Any degree of a good quality wou’d cause a stronger affection than the same degree of a bad quality wou’d cause hatred; contrary to what we find by experience. Men’s tempers are different, and some have a propensity to the tender, and others to the rougher, affections: But in the main, we may affirm, that man in general, or human nature, is nothing but <MPB ed="SBN" num="482"/>the object both of love and hatred, and requires some other cause, which by a double relation of impressions and ideas, may excite these passions. In vain wou’d we endeavour to elude this hypothesis. There are no ph<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>nomena that point out any such kind affection to men, independent of their merit, and every other circumstance. We love company in general; but ’tis as we love any other amusement. An <em>Englishman</em> in <OPB num="46"/><em>Italy</em> is a friend: A <em>Europ<del>œ</del><ins comment="originally 'œ'; separated to make searching easier">oe</ins>an</em> in <em>China</em>; and perhaps a man wou’d be belov’d as such, were we to meet him in the moon. But this proceeds only from the relation to ourselves; which in these cases gathers force by being confined to a few persons.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.13"><para><sc>If</sc> public benevolence, therefore, or a regard to the interests of mankind, cannot be the original motive to justice, much less can <em>private benevolence</em>, or a <em>regard to the interests of the party concern’d</em>, be this motive.

What if he be a miser, and can make no use of what I wou’d deprive him of? What if he be a profligate debauchee, and wou’d rather receive harm than benefit from large possessions? What if I be in necessity, and have urgent motives to acquire something to my family? In all these cases, the original motive to justice wou’d fail; and consequently the justice itself, and along with it all property, right, and obligation.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.14"><para><sc>A rich</sc> man lies under a moral obligation to communicate to those in necessity a share of his superfluities. Were private benevolence the original motive to justice, a <OPB num="47"/>man wou’d not be oblig’d to leave others in the possession of more than he is oblig’d to give them. At least the difference wou’d be very inconsiderable. Men generally fix their affections more on what they are possess’d of, than on what they never enjoy’d: For this reason, it wou’d be greater cruelty to dispossess a man of any thing, than not to give it him. But who will assert, that this is the only foundation of justice?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.15"><para><sc>Besides</sc>, we must consider, that the chief reason, why men <MPB ed="SBN" num="483"/>attach themselves so much to their possessions is, that they consider them as their property, and as secur’d to them inviolably by the laws of society. But this is a secondary consideration, and dependent on the preceding notions of justice and property.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.16"><para><sc>A man</sc>’<sc>s</sc> property is suppos’d to be fenc’d against every mortal, in every possible case.

Private benevolence, therefore, is not the original motive of justice.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.17"><para><sc>From</sc> all this it follows, that we have <ins comment="MS addition">naturally</ins> no real or universal motive for observing the laws of equity, but the very equity and me<OPB num="48"/>rit of that observance; and as no action can be equitable or meritorious, where it cannot arise from some separate motive, there is here an evident sophistry and reasoning in a circle. Unless, therefore, we will allow, that nature has establish’d a sophistry, and render’d it necessary and unavoidable, we must allow, that the sense of justice and injustice is not deriv’d from nature, but arises artificially, tho’ necessarily from education, and human conventions.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.18"><para><sc>I shall</sc> add, as a corollary to this reasoning, that since no action can be laudable or blameable, without some motives or impelling passions, distinct from the sense of morals, these distinct passions must have a great influence on that sense. ’Tis according to their general force in human nature, that we blame or praise. In judging of the beauty of animal bodies, we always carry in our eye the <del>œ</del><ins comment="originally 'œ'; separated to make searching easier">oe</ins>conomy of a certain species; and where the limbs and features observe that proportion, which is common to the species, we pronounce them handsome and beautiful. In like manner we always consider the <em>natural</em> and <em>usual</em> force of the passions, when we determine concerning vice and virtue; and if the passions depart very much from the common measures on either <OPB num="49"/>side, they are always disapprov’d as vicious. A man naturally loves his children better than his nephews, his nephews better than his <MPB ed="SBN" num="484"/>cousins, his cousins better than strangers, where every thing else is equal. Hence arise our common measures of duty, in preferring the one to the other. Our sense of duty always follows the common and natural course of our passions.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.1.19"><para><sc>To</sc> avoid giving offence, I must here observe, that when I deny justice to be a natural virtue, I make use of the word, <em>natural</em>, only as oppos’d to <em>artificial</em>. In another sense of the word; as no principle of the human mind is more natural than a sense of virtue; so no virtue is more natural than justice. Mankind is an inventive species; and where an invention is obvious and absolutely necessary, it may as properly be said to be natural as any thing that proceeds immediately from original principles, without the intervention of thought or reflection. Tho’ the rules of justice be <em>artificial</em>, they are not <em>arbitrary</em>. Nor is the expression improper to call them <em>Laws of Nature</em>; if by natural we understand what is common to any species, or even if we confine it to mean what is inseparable from the species.</para></dhot>

In other creatures these two particulars generally compensate each other. If we consider the lion as a <MPB ed="SBN" num="485"/>voracious and carnivorous animal, we shall easily discover him to be very necessitous; but if we turn <OPB num="51"/>our eye to his make and temper, his agility, his courage, his arms, and his force, we shall find, that his advantages hold proportion with his wants. The sheep and ox are depriv’d of all these advantages; but their appetites are moderate, and their food is of easy purchase. In man alone, this unnatural conjunction of infirmity, and of necessity, may be observ’d in its greatest perfection. Not only the food, which is requir’d for his sustenance, flies his search and approach, or at least requires his labour to be produc’d, but he must be possess’d of cloaths and lodging, to defend him against the injuries of the weather; tho’ to consider him only in himself, he is provided neither with arms, nor force, nor other natural abilities, which are in any degree answerable to so many necessities.</para></dhot>

When every individual person labours a-part, and only for himself, his force is too small to execute any considerable work; his labour being employ’d in supplying all his different necessities, he never attains a perfection in any particular art; and as his force and success are not at all times equal, the least failure in either of these particulars must be attended with inevitable ruin and misery.

Most fortunately, therefore, there is conjoin’d to those necessities, whose remedies are remote and obscure, another necessity, which having a present and more obvious remedy, may justly be regarded as <OPB num="53"/>the first and original principle of human society. This necessity is no other than that natural appetite betwixt the sexes, which unites them together, and preserves their union, till a new tye takes place in their concern for their common offspring. This new concern becomes also a principle of union betwixt the parents and offspring, and forms a more numerous society; where the parents govern by the advantage of their superior strength and wisdom, and at the same time are restrain’d in the exercise of their authority by that natural affection, which they bear their children. In a little time, custom and habit operating on the tender minds of the children, makes them sensible of the advantages, which they may reap from society, as well as fashions them by degrees for it, by rubbing off those rough corners and untoward affections, which prevent their coalition.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.5"><para><sc>For</sc> it must be confest, that however the circumstances of human nature may render an union necessary, and however those passions of lust and natural affection may seem to render it unavoidable; yet there are other particulars in our <em>natural temper</em>, and in our <em>outward circumstances</em>, which are very incommodious, and are even contrary to the <OPB num="54"/>requisite conjunction. Among the former, we may justly esteem our <em>selfishness</em> to be the most considerable. I am sensible, that, generally speaking, the representations of this quality have been carried much too far; and that the descriptions, which certain philosophers delight so much to form of mankind in this particular, are as wide of nature as any accounts of monsters, which we meet with in fables and <MPB ed="SBN" num="487"/>romances. So far from thinking, that men have no affection for any thing beyond themselves, I am of opinion, that tho’ it be rare to meet with one, who loves any single person better than himself; yet ’tis as rare to meet with one, in whom all the kind affections, taken together, do not over-balance all the selfish. Consult common experience: Do you not see, that tho’ the whole expence of the family be generally under the direction of the master of it, yet there are few that do not bestow the largest part of their fortunes on the pleasures of their wives, and the education of their children, reserving the smallest portion for their own proper use and entertainment<del>.</del><ins comment="originally a full-stop; but the sense seems to require a question mark">?</ins> This is what we may observe concerning such as have those endearing ties; and may presume, that the case would <OPB num="55"/>be the same with others, were they plac’d in a like situation.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.6"><para><sc>But</sc> tho’ this generosity must be acknowledg’d to the honour of human nature, we may at the same time remark, that so noble an affection, instead of fitting men for large societies, is almost as contrary to them, as the most narrow selfishness. For while each person loves himself better than any other single person, and in his love to others bears the greatest affection to his relations and acquaintance, this must necessarily produce an opposition of passions, and a consequent opposition of actions; which cannot but be dangerous to the new-establish’d union.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.7"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> however worth while to remark, that this contrariety of passions wou’d be attended with but small danger, did it not concur with a peculiarity in our <em>outward circumstances</em>, which affords it an opportunity of exerting itself. There are three different species of goods, which we are possess’d of; the internal satisfaction of our <del>minds</del><ins comment="originally 'minds'; manuscript alteration">mind</ins>, the external advantages of our body, and the enjoyment of such possessions as we have acquir’d by our industry and good fortune. We are perfectly secure in the enjoyment of the first. The second may be ravish’d from us, but can be of no advantage to him who <OPB num="56"/>deprives us of them. The last only are both expos’d to the violence of others, and may be transferr’d without suffer<MPB ed="SBN" num="488"/>ing any loss or alteration; while at the same time, there is not a sufficient quantity of them to supply every one’s desires and necessities. As the improvement, therefore, of these goods is the chief advantage of society, so the <em>instability</em> of their possession, along with their <em>scarcity</em>, is the chief impediment.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.8"><para><sc>In</sc> vain shou’d we expect to find, in <em>uncultivated nature</em>, a remedy to this inconvenience; or hope for any inartificial principle of the human mind, which might controul those partial affections, and make us overcome the temptations arising from our circumstances. The idea of justice can never serve to this purpose, or be taken for a natural principle, capable of inspiring men with an equitable conduct towards each other. That virtue, as it is now understood, wou’d never have been dream’d of among rude and savage men. For the notion of injury or injustice implies an immorality or vice committed against some other person: And as every immorality is deriv’d from some defect or unsoundness of the passions, and as this defect must be judg’d of, in a great measure, from the ordinary course of nature in <OPB num="57"/>the constitution of the mind; ’twill be easy to know, whether we be guilty of any immorality, with regard to others, by considering the natural, and usual force of those several affections, which are directed towards them. Now it appears, that in the original frame of our mind, our strongest attention is confin’d to ourselves; our next is extended to our relations and acquaintance; and ’tis only the weakest which reaches to strangers and indifferent persons. This partiality, then, and unequal affection, must not only have an influence on our behaviour and conduct in society, but even on our ideas of vice and virtue; so as to make us regard any remarkable transgression of such a degree of partiality, either by too great an enlargement, or contraction of the affections, as vicious and immoral. This we may observe in our common judgments concerning actions, where we blame a person, who either centers all his affections in his family, or <MPB ed="SBN" num="489"/>is so regardless of them, as, in any opposition of interest, to give the preference to a stranger, or mere chance acquaintance. From all which it follows, that our natural uncultivated ideas of morality, instead of providing a remedy for the partiality of our affections, do rather conform themselves to <OPB num="58"/>that partiality, and give it an additional force and influence.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.9"><para><sc>The</sc> remedy, then, is not deriv’d from nature, but from <em>artifice</em>; or more properly speaking, nature provides a remedy in the judgment and understanding, for what is irregular and incommodious in the affections. For when men, from their early education in society, have become sensible of the infinite advantages that result from it, and have besides acquir’d a new affection to company and conversation; and when they have observ’d, that the principal disturbance in society arises from those goods, which we call external, and from their looseness and easy transition from one person to another; they must seek for a remedy, by putting these goods, as far as possible, on the same footing with the fix’d and constant advantages of the mind and body. This can be done after no other manner, than by a convention enter’d into by all the members of the society to bestow stability on the possession of those external goods, and leave every one in the peaceable enjoyment of what he may acquire by his fortune and industry. By this means, every one knows what he may safely possess; and the passions are restrain’d in their partial and contradi<OPB num="59"/>ctory motions. Nor is such a restraint contrary to these passions; for if so, it cou’d never be enter’d into, nor maintain’d; but it is only contrary to their heedless and impetuous movement. Instead of departing from our own interest, or from that of our nearest friends, by abstaining from the possessions of others, we cannot better consult both these interests, than by such a convention; because it is by that means we maintain society, which is so necessary to their well-being and subsistence, as well as to our own.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.10"><MPB ed="SBN" num="490"/><para><sc>This</sc> convention is not of the nature of a <em>promise:</em> For even promises themselves, as we shall see afterwards, arise from human conventions. It is only a general sense of common interest; which sense all the members of the society express to one another, and which induces them to regulate their conduct by certain rules. I observe, that it will be for my interest to leave another in the possession of his goods, <em>provided</em> he will act in the same manner with regard to me. He is sensible of a like interest in the regulation of his conduct. When this common sense of interest is mutually express’d, and is known to both, it produces a suitable resolution and behaviour. And this may properly enough be call’d a convention or agreement <OPB num="60"/>betwixt us, tho’ without the interposition of a promise; since the actions of each of us have a reference to those of the other, and are perform’d upon the supposition, that something is to be perform’d on the other part. Two men, who pull the oars of a boat, do it by an agreement or convention, tho’ they have never given promises to each other. Nor is the rule concerning the stability of possession the less deriv’d from human conventions, that it arises gradually, and acquires force by a slow progression, and by our repeated experience of the inconveniences of transgressing it. On the contrary, this experience assures us still more, that the sense of interest has become common to all our fellows, and gives us a confidence of the future regularity of their conduct: And ’tis only on the expectation of this, that our moderation and abstinence are founded. In like manner are languages gradually establish’d by human conventions without any promise. In like manner do gold and silver become the common measures of exchange, and are esteem’d sufficient payment for what is of a hundred times their value.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.11"><para><sc>After</sc> this convention, concerning abstinence from the possessions of others, is enter’d into, and every one has acquir’d <OPB num="61"/>a stability in his possessions, there immediately arise the ideas of justice and injustice; as also those of <em>property</em>, <MPB ed="SBN" num="491"/><em>right</em>, and <em>obligation</em>. The latter are altogether unintelligible without first understanding the former. Our property is nothing but those goods, whose constant possession is establish’d by the laws of society; that is, by the laws of justice. Those, therefore, who make use of the words <em>property</em>, or <em>right</em>, or <em>obligation</em>, before they have explain’d the origin of justice, or even make use of <del>it</del><ins comment="originally 'it'; ERRATA change (N.B. Selby-Bigge/Nidditch instead changes 'words' to 'word' above, in keeping with a manuscript alteration)">them</ins> in that explication, are guilty of a very gross fallacy, and can never reason upon any solid foundation. A man’s property is some object related to him. This relation is not natural, but moral, and founded on justice. ’Tis very preposterous, therefore, to imagine, that we can have any idea of property, without fully comprehending the nature of justice, and shewing its origin in the artifice and contrivance of men. The origin of justice explains that of property<del>,</del><ins comment="originally a comma; presumably either a full-stop or a colon is intended, given the sense and the subsequent capital letter, but it is hard to say which; a full-stop seems the least intrusive option">.</ins> The same artifice gives rise to both. As our first and most natural sentiment of morals is founded on the nature of our passions, and gives the preference to ourselves and friends, above strangers; ’tis impossible there can be naturally any such thing as a fix’d right or pro<OPB num="62"/>perty, while the opposite passions of men impel them in contrary directions, and are not restrain’d by any convention or agreement.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.12"><para><sc>No</sc> one can doubt, that the convention for the distinction of property, and for the stability of possession, is of all circumstances the most necessary to the establishment of human society, and that after the agreement for the fixing and observing of this rule, there remains little or nothing to be done towards settling a perfect harmony and concord. All the other passions, beside this of interest, are either easily restrain’d, or are not of such pernicious consequence, when indulg’d. <em>Vanity</em> is rather to be esteem’d a social passion, and a bond of union among men. <em>Pity</em> and <em>love</em> are to be consider’d in the same light. And as to <em>envy</em> and <em>revenge</em>, tho’ pernicious, they operate only by intervals, and are directed against particular persons, whom we consider as our superiors or enemies. This avidity alone, of acquiring <MPB ed="SBN" num="492"/>goods and possessions for ourselves and our nearest friends, is insatiable, perpetual, universal, and directly destructive of society. There scarce is any one, who is not actuated by it; and there is no one, who has not reason to fear from it, when it acts without <OPB num="63"/>any restraint, and gives way to its first and most natural movements. So that upon the whole, we are to esteem the difficulties in the establishment of society, to be greater or less, according to those we encounter in regulating and restraining this passion.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.13"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> certain, that no affection of the human mind has both a sufficient force, and a proper direction to counter-balance the love of gain, and render men fit members of society, by making them abstain from the possessions of others. Benevolence to strangers is too weak for this purpose; and as to the other passions, they rather inflame this avidity, when we observe, that the larger our possessions are, the more ability we have of gratifying all our appetites. There is no passion, therefore, capable of controlling the interested affection, but the very affection it self, by an alteration of its direction. Now this alteration must necessarily take place upon the least reflection; since ’tis evident, that the passion is much better satisfy’d by its restraint, than by its liberty, and that <del>in</del><ins comment="originall 'in'; manuscript alteration">by</ins> preserving society, we make much greater advances in the acquiring possessions, than <del>in</del><ins comment="originall 'in'; manuscript alteration">by running into</ins> the solitary and forlorn condition, which must follow upon violence and an universal licence. The question, therefore, concern<OPB num="64"/>ing the wickedness or goodness of human nature, enters not in the least into that other question concerning the origin of society; nor is there any thing to be consider’d but the degrees of men’s sagacity or folly. For whether the passion of self-interest be esteemed vicious or virtuous, ’tis all a case; since itself alone restrains it: So that if it be virtuous, men become social by their virtue; if vicious, their vice has the same effect.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.14"><para><sc>Now</sc> as ’tis by establishing the rule for the stability of <MPB ed="SBN" num="493"/>possession, that this passion restrains itself; if that rule be very abstruse, and of difficult invention; society must be esteem’d, in a manner, accidental, and the effect of many ages. But if it be found, that nothing can be more simple and obvious than that rule; that every parent, in order to preserve peace among his children, must establish it; and that these first rudiments of justice must every day be improv’d, as the society enlarges: If all this appear evident, as it certainly must, we may conclude, that ’tis utterly impossible for men to remain any considerable time in that savage condition, which precedes society; but that his very first state and situation may justly be esteem’d social. This, however, hinders not, but that philosophers may, if they please, <OPB num="65"/>extend their reasoning to the suppos’d <em>state of nature</em>; provided they allow it to be a mere philosophical fiction, which never had, and never cou’d have any reality. Human nature being compos’d of two principal parts, which are requisite in all its actions, the affections and understanding; ’tis certain, that the blind motions of the former, without the direction of the latter, incapacitate men for society: And it may be allow’d us to consider separately the effects, that result from the separate operations of these two component parts of the mind. The same liberty may be permitted to moral, which is allow’d to natural philosophers; and ’tis very usual with the latter to consider any motion as compounded and consisting of two parts separate from each other, tho’ at the same time they acknowledge it to be in itself uncompounded and inseparable.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.15"><para><sc>This</sc> <em>state of nature</em>, therefore, is to be regarded as a mere fiction, not unlike that of the <em>golden age</em>, which poets have invented; only with this difference, that the former is describ’d as full of war, violence and injustice; whereas the latter is painted out to us, as the most charming and most peaceable condition, that can possibly be imagin’d. The seasons, in that first age of na<OPB num="66"/>ture, were so temperate, if we may believe the poets, that there was no necessity for men to provide them<MPB ed="SBN" num="494"/>selves with cloaths and houses as a security against the violence of heat and cold. The rivers flow’d with wine and milk: The oaks yielded honey; and nature spontaneously produc’d her greatest delicacies. Nor were these the chief advantages of that happy age. The storms and tempests were not alone remov’d from nature; but those more furious tempests were unknown to human breasts, which now cause such uproar, and engender such confusion. Avarice, ambition, cruelty, selfishness, were never heard of: Cordial affection, compassion, sympathy, were the only movements, with which the human mind was yet acquainted. Even the distinction of <em>mine</em> and <em>thine</em> was banish’d from that happy race of mortals, and carry’d with them the very notions of property and obligation, justice and injustice.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.16"><para><sc>This</sc>, no doubt, is to be regarded as an idle fiction; but yet deserves our attention, because nothing can more evidently shew the origin of those virtues, which are the subjects of our present enquiry. I have already observ’d, that justice takes its rise from human conventions; and that these are in<OPB num="67"/>tended as a remedy to some inconveniences, which proceed from the concurrence of certain <em>qualities</em> of the human mind with the <em>situation</em> of external objects. The qualities of the mind are <em>selfishness</em> and <em>limited generosity:</em> And the situation of external objects is their <em>easy change</em>, join’d to their <em>scarcity</em> in comparison of the wants and desires of men. But however philosophers may have been bewilder’d in those speculations, poets have been guided more infallibly, by a certain taste or common instinct, which in most kinds of reasoning goes farther than any of that art and philosophy, with which we have been yet acquainted. They easily perceiv’d, if every man had a tender regard for another, or if nature supplied abundantly all our wants and desires, that the jealousy of interest, which justice supposes, could no longer have place; nor would there be any occasion for those distinctions and limits of property and possession, which at present are in use among mankind. Encrease to a sufficient degree the bene<MPB ed="SBN" num="495"/>volence of men, or the bounty of nature, and you render justice useless, by supplying its place with much nobler virtues, and more valuable blessings. The selfishness of men is animated by the few possessions we have, in propor<OPB num="68"/>tion to our wants; and ’tis to restrain this selfishness, that men have been oblig’d to separate themselves from the community, and to distinguish betwixt their own goods and those of others.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.17"><para><sc>Nor</sc> need we have recourse to the fictions of poets to learn this; but beside the reason of the thing, may discover the same truth by common experience and observation. ’Tis easy to remark, that a cordial affection renders all things common among friends; and that married people in particular mutually lose their property, and are unacquainted with the <em>mine</em> and <em>thine</em>, which are so necessary, and yet cause such disturbance in human society. The same effect arises from any alteration in the circumstances of mankind; as when there is such a plenty of any thing as satisfies all the desires of men: In which case the distinction of property is entirely lost, and every thing remains in common. This we may observe with regard to air and water, tho’ the most valuable of all external objects; and may easily conclude, that if men were supplied with every thing in the same abundance, or if <em>every one</em> had the same affection and tender regard for <em>every one</em> as for himself; justice and injustice would be equally unknown among mankind.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.18"><para><sc>Here</sc> then is a proposition, which, I think, may be regarded as certain, <em>that ’tis only from the selfishness and confin’d generosity of men, along with the scanty provision nature has made for his wants, that justice derives its origin</em>. If we look backward we shall find, that this proposition bestows an additional force on some of those observations, which we have already made on this subject.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.19"><para><em>First</em>, we may conclude from it, that a regard to public interest, or a strong extensive benevolence, is not our first and original motive for the observation of the rules of jus<MPB ed="SBN" num="496"/>tice; since ’tis allow’d, that if men were endow’d with such a benevolence, these rules would never have been dreamt of.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.20"><para><em>Secondly</em>, we may conclude from the same principle, that the sense of justice is not founded on reason, or on the discovery of certain connexions and relations of ideas, which are eternal, immutable, and universally obligatory. For since it is confest, that such an alteration as that above-mention’d, in the temper and circumstances of mankind, wou’d entirely alter our duties and obligations, ’tis necessary upon the common system, <em>that the sense of virtue is deriv’d from reason</em>, to shew <OPB num="70"/>the change which this must produce in the relations and ideas. But ’tis evident, that the only cause, why the extensive generosity of man, and the perfect abundance of every thing, wou’d destroy the very idea of justice, is because they render it useless; and that, on the other hand, his confin’d benevolence, and his necessitous condition, give rise to that virtue, only by making it requisite to the publick interest, and to that of every individual. ’Twas therefore a concern for our own, and the publick interest, which made us establish the laws of justice; and nothing can be more certain, than that it is not any relation of ideas, which gives us this concern, but our impressions and sentiments, without which every thing in nature is perfectly indifferent to us; and can never in the least affect us. The sense of justice, therefore, is not founded on our ideas, but on our impressions.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.21"><para><em>Thirdly</em>, we may farther confirm the foregoing proposition, <em>that those impressions, which give rise to this sense of justice, are not natural to the mind of man, but arise from artifice and human conventions</em>. For since any considerable alteration of temper and circumstances destroys equally justice and injustice; and since such an alteration has an <OPB num="71"/>effect only by changing our own and the publick interest; it follows, that the first establishment of the rules of justice depends on these different interests. But if men pursu’d the publick interest naturally, and with a hearty affection, they wou’d never have dream’d of restraining each other by these rules; <MPB ed="SBN" num="497"/>and if they pursu’d their own interest, without any precaution, they wou’d run head-long into every kind of injustice and violence. These rules, therefore, are artificial, and seek their end in an oblique and indirect manner; nor is the interest, which gives rise to them, of a kind that cou’d be pursu’d by the natural and inartificial passions of men.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.22"><para><sc>To</sc> make this more evident, consider, that tho’ the rules of justice are establish’d merely by interest, their connexion with interest is somewhat singular, and is different from what may be observ’d on other occasions. A single act of justice is frequently contrary to <em>public interest</em>; and were it to stand alone, without being follow’d by other acts, may, in itself, be very prejudicial to society. When a man of merit, of a beneficent disposition, restores a great fortune to a miser, or a seditious bigot, he has acted justly and laudably, but the public is a real sufferer. Nor is <OPB num="72"/>every single act of justice, consider’d apart, more conducive to private interest, than to public; and ’tis easily conceiv’d how a man may impoverish himself by a signal instance of integrity, and have reason to wish, that with regard to that single act, the laws of justice were for a moment suspended in the universe. But however single acts of justice may be contrary, either to public or private interest, ’tis certain, that the whole plan or scheme is highly conducive, or indeed absolutely requisite, both to the support of society, and the well-being of every individual. ’Tis impossible to separate the good from the ill. Property must be stable, and must be fix’d by general rules. Tho’ in one instance the public be a sufferer, this momentary ill is amply compensated by the steady prosecution of the rule, and by the peace and order, which it establishes in society. And even every individual person must find himself a gainer, on ballancing the account; since, without justice, society must immediately dissolve, and every one must fall into that savage and solitary condition, which is infinitely worse than the worst situation that can possibly be suppos’d in society. When therefore men have <MPB ed="SBN" num="498"/>had experience enough to observe, that whatever <OPB num="73"/>may be the consequence of any single act of justice, perform’d by a single person, yet the whole system of actions, concurr’d in by the whole society, is infinitely advantageous to the whole, and to every part; it is not long before justice and property take place. Every member of society is sensible of this interest: Every one expresses this sense to his fellows, along with the resolution he has taken of squaring his actions by it, on condition that others will do the same. No more is requisite to induce any one of them to perform an act of justice, who has the first opportunity. This becomes an example to others. And thus justice establishes itself by a kind of convention or agreement; that is, by a sense of interest, suppos’d to be common to all, and where every single act is perform’d in expectation that others are to perform the like. Without such a convention, no one wou’d ever have dream’d, that there was such a virtue as justice, or have been induc’d to conform his actions to it. Taking any single act, my justice may be pernicious in every respect; and ’tis only upon the supposition, that others are to imitate my example, that I can be induc’d to embrace that virtue; since nothing but this combination can render justice advantageous, <OPB num="74"/>or afford me any motives to conform my self to its rules.<br/></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.23"><para>We come now to the <em>second</em> question we propos’d, <em>viz. Why we annex the idea of virtue to justice, and of vice to injustice</em>. This question will not detain us long after the principles, which we have already establish’d. All we can say of it at present will be dispatch’d in a few words: And for farther satisfaction, the reader must wait till we come to the <em>third</em> part of this book. The <em>natural</em> obligation to justice, <em>viz.</em> interest, has been fully explain’d; but as to the <em>moral</em> obligation, or the sentiment of right and wrong, ’twill first be requisite to examine the natural virtues, before we can give a full and satisfactory account of it.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.24"><para><sc>After</sc> men have found by experience, that their selfishness <MPB ed="SBN" num="499"/>and confin’d generosity, acting at their liberty, totally incapacitate them for society; and at the same time have observ’d, that society is necessary to the satisfaction of those very passions, they are naturally induc’d to lay themselves under the restraint of such rules, as may render their commerce more safe and commodious. To the imposition then, and observance of these rules, both in general, and in every particu<OPB num="75"/>lar instance, they are at first <del>induc’d</del><ins comment="originally 'induc’d'; manuscript alteration">mov’d</ins> only by a regard to interest; and this motive, on the first formation of society, is sufficiently strong and forcible. But when society has become numerous, and has encreas’d to a tribe or nation, this interest is more remote; nor do men so readily perceive, that disorder and confusion follow upon every breach of these rules, as in a more narrow and contracted society. But tho’ in our own actions we may frequently lose sight of that interest, which we have in maintaining order, and may follow a lesser and more present interest, we never fail to observe the prejudice we receive, either mediately or immediately, from the injustice of others; as not being in that case either blinded by passion, or byass’d by any contrary temptation. Nay when the injustice is so distant from us, as no way to affect our interest, it still displeases us; because we consider it as prejudicial to human society, and pernicious to every one that approaches the person guilty of it. We partake of their uneasiness by <em>sympathy</em>; and as every thing, which gives uneasiness in human actions, upon the general survey, is call’d Vice, and whatever produces satisfaction, in the same manner, is denominated Virtue; this is the reason why the sense of moral good and evil follows upon justice and injustice. And tho’ this sense, in <OPB num="76"/>the present case, be deriv’d only from contemplating the actions of others, yet we fail not to extend it even to our own actions. The <em>general rule</em> reaches beyond those instances, from which it arose; while at the same time we naturally <em>sympathize</em> with others in the sentiments they entertain of us. <em>Thus self-interest is the original motive to the </em>establishment<em> of justice: but a </em>sympathy <MPB ed="SBN" num="500"/><em>with public interest is the source of the </em>moral approbation,<em> which attends that virtue</em>. <ins comment="MS addition">This latter principle of sympathy is too weak to controul our passions, but has sufficient force to influence our taste, and give us the sentiments of approbation or blame.</ins></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.2.25"><para><sc>Tho</sc>’ this progress of the sentiments be <em>natural</em>, and even necessary, ’tis certain, that it is here forwarded by the artifice of politicians, who, in order to govern men more easily, and preserve peace in human society, have endeavour’d to produce an esteem for justice, and an abhorrence of injustice. This, no doubt, must have its effect; but nothing can be more evident, than that the matter has been carry’d too far by certain writers on morals, who seem to have employ’d their utmost efforts to extirpate all sense of virtue from among mankind. Any artifice of politicians may assist nature in the producing of those sentiments, which she suggests to us, and may even on some occasions, produce alone an approbation or esteem for any particular action; but ’tis impossible it should be the sole cause of the distinction we make betwixt vice and virtue. <OPB num="77"/>For if nature did not aid us in this particular, ’twou’d be in vain for politicians to talk of <em>honourable</em> or <em>dishonourable</em>, <em>praiseworthy</em> or <em>blameable</em>. These words wou’d be perfectly unintelligible, and wou’d no more have any idea annex’d to them, than if they were of a tongue perfectly unknown to us.

For as parents easily observe, that a man is the more useful, both to himself and others, the greater degree of probity and honour he is endow’d with; and that those principles have greater force, when custom and education assist interest and reflection: For these reasons they are induc’d to inculcate on their children, from their earliest infancy, the principles of probity, and teach them to regard the observance of those rules, by which society is maintain’d, as worthy and honourable, and their violation as base and <MPB ed="SBN" num="501"/>infamous.

<dhot id="T 3.2.3.1"><para><ac><dc>T</dc>ho’</ac> the establishment of the rule, concerning the stability of possession, be not only useful, but even absolutely necessary to human society, it can never serve to any purpose, <MPB ed="SBN" num="502"/>while it remains in such general terms. Some method must be shewn, by which we may distinguish what particular goods are to be assign’d to each particular person, while the rest of mankind are excluded from their possession and enjoyment. Our next business, then, must be to discover the reasons which modify this general rule, and fit it to the common use and practice of the world.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.3.2"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> obvious, that those reasons are not deriv’d from any utility or advantage, which <OPB num="80"/>either the <em>particular</em> person or the public may reap from his enjoyment of any <em>particular</em> goods, beyond what wou’d result from the possession of them by any other person. ’Twere better, no doubt, that every one were possess’d of what is most suitable to him, and proper for his use: But besides, that this relation of fitness may be common to several at once, ’tis liable to so many controversies, and men are so partial and passionate in judging of these controversies, that such a loose and uncertain rule wou’d be absolutely incompatible with the peace of human society. The convention concerning the stability of possession is enter’d into, in order to cut off all occasions of discord and contention; and this end wou’d never be attain’d, were we allow’d to apply this rule differently in every particular case, according to every particular utility, which might be discover’d in such an application. Justice, in her decisions, never regards the fitness or unfitness of objects to particular persons, but conducts herself by more extensive views. Whether a man be generous, or a miser, he is equally well receiv’d by her, and obtains with the same facility a decision in his favours, even for what is entirely useless to him.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.3.3"><para><sc>It</sc> follows, therefore, that the general rule, <em>that possession must be stable</em>, is not apply’d by particular judgments, but by other general rules, which must extend to the whole society, and be inflexible either by spite or favour. To illustrate this, I propose the following instance. I first consider men in their savage and solitary condition; and suppose, that <MPB ed="SBN" num="503"/>being sensible of the misery of that state, and foreseeing the advantages that wou’d result from society, they seek each other’s company, and make an offer of mutual protection and assistance. I also suppose, that they are endow’d with such sagacity as immediately to perceive, that the chief impediment to this project of society and partnership lies in the avidity and selfishness of their natural temper; to remedy which, they enter into a convention for the stability of possession, and for mutual restraint and forbearance. I am sensible, that this method of proceeding is not altogether natural; but besides that I here only suppose those reflections to be form’d at once, which in fact arise insensibly and by degrees; besides this, I say, ’tis very possible, that several persons, being by different accidents separated from the societies, to which they formerly belong’d, may be oblig’d to form a new society <OPB num="82"/>among themselves; in which case they are entirely in the situation above-mention’d.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.3.4"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> evident, then, that their first difficulty, in this situation, after the general convention for the establishment of society, and for the constancy of possession, is, how to separate their possessions, and assign to each his particular portion, which he must for the future inalterably enjoy. This difficulty will not detain them long; but it must immediately <del>occur to them</del><ins comment="originally 'occur to them'; manuscript deletion">occur</ins>, as the most natural expedient, that every one continue to enjoy what he is at present master of, and that property or constant possession be conjoin’d to the immediate possession. Such is the effect of custom, that it not only reconciles us to any thing we have long enjoy’d, but even gives us an affection for it, and makes us prefer it to other objects, which may be more valuable, but are less known to us. What has long lain under our eye, and has often been employ’d to our advantage, <em>that</em> we are always the most unwilling to part with; but can easily live without possessions, which we never have enjoy’d, and are not accustom’d to. ’Tis evident, therefore, that men wou’d easily acquiesce in this expedient, <em>that every one continue to enjoy what he is at present possess’d <MPB ed="SBN" num="504"/>of</em>; <OPB num="83"/>and this is the reason, why they wou’d so naturally agree in preferring it<footnote num="71" sym="a"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.3.5"><MPB ed="SBN" num="505"/><para><sc>But</sc> we may observe, that tho’ the rule of the assignment of property to the present possessor be natural, and by that means use<OPB num="84"/>ful, yet its utility extends not beyond the first formation of society; nor wou’d any thing be more pernicious, than the constant observance of it; by which restitution wou’d be excluded, and every injustice wou’d be authoriz’d and rewarded. We must, therefore, seek for some other circumstance, that may give rise to property after society is once establish’d; and of this kind, I find four most considerable, <em>viz.</em> Occupation, Prescription, Accession, and Succession. We shall <OPB num="85"/>briefly examine each of these, beginning with <em>Occupation.</em></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.3.6"><para><sc>The</sc> possession of all external goods is changeable and uncertain; which is one of the most considerable impediments to the establishment of society, and is the reason why, by universal agreement, express or tacite, men restrain themselves by what we now call the rules of justice and equity. The misery of the condition, which precedes this restraint, is the cause why we submit to that remedy as quickly as possible; and this <del>affords us</del><ins comment="originally 'affords us'; manuscript deletion">affords</ins> an easy reason, why we annex the idea of property to the first possession, or to <em>occupation</em>. Men are unwilling to leave property in suspence, even for the shortest time, or open the least door to violence and disorder. To which we may add, that the first possession always engages the attention most; and did we neglect it, there wou’d be no colour of reason for assigning property to any succeeding possession<footnote num="72" sym="b"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.3.7"><MPB ed="SBN" num="506"/><para><sc>There</sc> remains nothing, but to determine exactly, what is meant by possession; and this is not so easy as may at first sight be imagin’d. We are said to be in possession of any thing, not only when we immediately touch it, but also when we are so situated with respect to it, as to have it in our power to use it; and may move, alter, or destroy it, according to our present pleasure or advantage. This relation, then, is a species of cause and effect; and as property is nothing but a stable possession, deriv’d from the rules of justice, or the conventions of men, ’tis to be consider’d as the same species of relation. But here we may observe, that as the power of using any object becomes more or less certain, according as the interruptions we may meet with are more or less probable; and as this probability may increase by insensible degrees; ’tis in many cases impossible to determine when possession begins or ends; nor is there any certain standard, by which we can decide such controversies. A wild boar, that falls into our snares, is deem’d to be in our possession, if <OPB num="87"/>it be impossible for him to escape. But what do we mean by impossible? How do we separate this impossibility from an improbability? And how distinguish that exactly from a probability? Mark the precise limits of the one and the other, and shew the standard, by which we may decide all disputes that may arise, and, as we find by experience, frequently do arise upon this subject<footnote num="73" sym="c"/>.</para></dhot>

A person who lands on the shore of a small island, that is desart and uncultivated, is deem’d its possessor from the very first moment, and acquires <OPB num="89"/>the property of the whole; because the object is there bounded and circumscrib’d in the fancy, and at the same time is proportion’d to the new possessor.

The <OPB num="90"/>nature of human society admits not of any great accuracy; nor can we always remount to the first origin of things, in order to determine their present condition. Any considerable space of time sets objects at such a distance, that they seem, in a manner, to lose their reality, and have as little influence on the mind, as if they never had been in being. A man’s title, that is clear and certain at present, will seem obscure and doubtful fifty years hence, even tho’ the facts, on which it is founded, shou’d be prov’d with the greatest evidence and certainty. The same facts have not the same influence after so long an interval of time. And this may be receiv’d as a convincing argument for our preceding doctrine with regard to property and justice. Possession during a long tract of time conveys a title to any object. But as ’tis certain, that, however every <MPB ed="SBN" num="509"/>thing be produc’d in time, there is nothing real, that is produc’d by time; it follows, that property being produc’d by time, is not any thing real in the objects, but is the offspring of the sentiments, on which alone time is found to have any influence<footnote num="74" sym="d"/>.</para></dhot>

Where objects are connected together in the imagination, they are apt to be put on the same footing, and are commonly suppos’d to be endow’d with the same qualities.

<dhot id="T 3.2.4.1"><para><ac><dc>H</dc>owever</ac> useful, or even necessary, the stability of possession may be to human society, ’tis attended with very considerable inconveniences. The relation of fitness or suitableness ought never to enter into consideration, in distributing the properties of mankind; but we must govern ourselves by rules, which are more general in their application, and more free from doubt and uncertainty. Of this kind is <em>present</em> possession upon the first establishment of society; and afterwards <em>occupation</em>,  <em>prescription</em>, <em>accession</em>, and <em>succession</em>. As these depend very much on chance, they must frequently prove contradictory both to men’s wants and desires; and persons and possessions must often be very ill adjusted. This is a grand inconvenience, which calls for a remedy. To apply one directly, and allow every man to seize by violence what he judges to be fit for him, wou’d destroy society; and therefore the rules of justice <OPB num="99"/>seek some medium betwixt a rigid stability, and this changeable and uncertain adjustment. But there is no medium better than that obvious one, that possession and property shou’d always be stable, except when the proprietor <del>consents</del><ins comment="originally 'consents'; manuscript alteration">agrees</ins> to bestow them on some other person. This rule can have no ill consequence, in occasioning wars and dissentions; since the proprietor’s consent, who alone is concern’d, is taken along in the alienation: And it may serve to many good purposes in adjusting property to persons. Different parts of the earth produce different commodities; and not only so, but different men both are by nature fitted for different employments, and attain to greater perfection in any one, when they confine themselves to it alone. All this requires a mutual exchange and commerce; for which reason the translation of property by consent is founded on a law of nature, as well as its stability without such a consent.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.4.2"><MPB ed="SBN" num="515"/><para><sc>So</sc> far is determin’d by a plain utility and interest. But perhaps ’tis from more trivial reasons, that <em>delivery</em>, or a sensible transference of the object is commonly requir’d by civil laws, and also by the laws of nature, according to most authors, as a requisite circumstance in the translation of pro<OPB num="100"/>perty. The property of an object, when taken for something real, without any reference to morality, or the sentiments of the mind, is a quality perfectly insensible, and even inconceivable; nor can we form any distinct notion, either of its stability or translation. This imperfection of our ideas is less sensibly felt with regard to its stability, as it engages less our attention, and is easily past over by the mind, without any scrupulous examination. But as the translation of property from one person to another is a more remarkable event, the defect of our ideas becomes more sensible on that occasion, and obliges us to turn ourselves on every side in search of some remedy. Now as nothing more enlivens any idea than a present impression, and a relation betwixt that impression and the idea; ’tis natural for us to seek some false light from this quarter. In order to aid the imagination in conceiving the transference of property, we take the sensible object, and actually transfer its possession to the person, on whom we wou’d bestow the property. The suppos’d resemblance of the actions, and the presence of this sensible delivery, deceive the mind, and make it fancy, that it conceives the mysterious transition of the property. And that <OPB num="101"/>this explication of the matter is just, appears hence, that men have invented a <em>symbolical</em> delivery, to satisfy the fancy, where the real one is impracticable. Thus the giving the keys of a granary is understood to be the delivery of the corn contain’d in it: The giving of stone and earth represents the delivery of a mannor. This is a kind of superstitious practice in civil laws, and in the laws of nature, resembling the <em>Roman catholic</em> superstitions in religion. As the <em>Roman catholics</em> represent the inconceivable mysteries of the <em>Christian</em> religion, and render them more present to the mind, by <MPB ed="SBN" num="516"/>a taper, or habit, or grimace, which is suppos’d to resemble them; so lawyers and moralists have run into like inventions for the same reason, and have endeavour’d by those means to satisfy themselves concerning the transference of property by consent.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5"><title><h3><wide>SEC</wide>T.<wide> </wide>V.</h3><h4><em>Of the obligation of promises.</em></h4></title></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.1"><para><ac><dc>T</dc>hat</ac> the rule of morality, which enjoins the performance of promises, is not <em>natural</em>, will sufficiently appear from <OPB num="102"/>these two propositions, which I proceed to prove, viz. <em>that a promise wou’d not be intelligible, before human conventions had establish’d it</em>; and <em>that even if it were intelligible, it wou’d not be attended with any moral obligation</em>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.2"><para><sc>I say</sc>, <em>first</em>, that a promise is not intelligible naturally, nor antecedent to human conventions; and that a man, unacquainted with society, could never enter into any engagements with another, even tho’ they could perceive each other’s thoughts by intuition. If promises be natural and intelligible, there must be some act of the mind attending these words, <em>I promise</em>; and on this act of the mind must the obligation depend. Let us, therefore, run over all the faculties of the soul, and see which of them is exerted in our promises.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.3"><para><sc>The</sc> act of the mind, exprest by a promise, is not a <em>resolution</em> to perform any thing: For that alone never imposes any obligation. Nor is it a <em>desire</em> of such a performance: For we may bind ourselves without such a desire, or even with an aversion, declar’d and avow’d. Neither is it the <em>willing</em> of that action, which we promise to perform: For a promise always regards some future time, and the will has an influence <OPB num="103"/>only on present actions. It follows, therefore, that since the act of the mind, which enters into a promise, and produces its obligation, is neither the resolving, desiring, nor willing any particular performance, it must necessarily be the <em>willing</em> of that<em>obligation</em>, which arises from the promise. Nor is this <MPB ed="SBN" num="517"/>only a conclusion of philosophy; but is entirely conformable to our common ways of thinking and of expressing ourselves, when we say that we are bound by our own consent, and that the obligation arises from our mere will and pleasure. The only question, then, is, whether there be not a manifest absurdity in supposing this act of the mind, and such an absurdity as no man cou’d fall into, whose ideas are not confounded <del>with</del><ins comment="originall 'with'; manuscript alteration">by</ins> prejudice and the fallacious use of language.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.4"><para><sc>All</sc> morality depends upon our sentiments; and when any action, or quality of the mind, pleases us <em>after a certain manner</em>, we say it is virtuous; and when the neglect, or non-performance of it, displeases us <em>after a like manner</em>, we say that we lie under an obligation to perform it. A change of the obligation supposes a change of the sentiment; and a creation of a new obligation supposes some new sentiment to arise. But ’tis certain we can naturally no more <OPB num="104"/>change our own sentiments, than the motions of the heavens; nor by a single act of our will, that is, by a promise, render any action agreeable or disagreeable, moral or immoral; which, without that act, wou’d have produc’d contrary impressions, or have been endow’d with different qualities. It wou’d be absurd, therefore, to will any new obligation, that is, any new sentiment of pain or pleasure; nor is it possible, that men cou’d naturally fall into so gross an absurdity. A promise, therefore, is <em>naturally</em> something altogether unintelligible, nor is there any act of the mind belonging to it<footnote num="77" sym="a"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.5"><MPB ed="SBN" num="518"/><para><sc>But</sc>, <em>secondly</em>, if there was any act of the mind belonging to it, it could not <em>naturally</em> produce any obligation. This appears evidently from the foregoing reasoning. A promise creates a new obligation. A new obligation supposes new sentiments to arise. The will never creates new sentiments. There could not naturally, therefore, arise any obligation from a promise, even supposing the mind could fall into the absurdity of willing that obligation.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.6"><para><sc>The</sc> same truth may be prov’d still more evidently by that reasoning, which prov’d justice in general to be an artificial virtue. No action can be requir’d of us as our duty, unless there be implanted in human nature some actuating passion or motive, capable of producing the action. This motive cannot be the sense of duty. A sense of duty supposes an antecedent obligation: And where an action is not requir’d by any natural passion, it cannot be requir’d by any natural obligation; since it may be omitted without <OPB num="106"/>proving any defect or imperfection in the mind and temper, and consequently without any vice. Now ’tis evident we have no motive leading us to the performance of promises, distinct from a sense of duty. If we thought, that promises had no moral obligation, we never shou’d feel any inclination to observe them. This is not the case with the natural virtues. Tho’ there was no obligation to relieve the miserable, our humanity wou’d lead us to it; and when we omit that duty, the immorality of the omission arises from its being a proof, that we want the natural sentiments of humanity. A father knows it to be his duty to take care of his children: But he <MPB ed="SBN" num="519"/>has also a natural inclination to it. And if no human creature had that inclination, no one cou’d lie under any such obligation. But as there is naturally no inclination to observe promises, distinct from a sense of their obligation; it follows, that fidelity is no natural virtue, and that promises have no force, antecedent to human conventions.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.7"><para><sc>If</sc> any one dissent from this, he must give a regular proof of these two propositions, viz. <em>that there is a peculiar act of the mind, annext to promises</em>; and <em>that consequent to this act of the mind, there arises an <OPB num="107"/>inclination to perform, distinct from a sense of duty</em>. I presume, that it is impossible to prove either of these two points; and therefore I venture to conclude, that promises are human inventions, founded on the necessities and interests of society.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.8"><para><sc>In</sc> order to discover these necessities and interests, we must consider the same qualities of human nature, which we have already found to give rise to the preceding laws of society. Men being naturally selfish, or endow’d only with a confin’d generosity, they are not easily induc’d to perform any action for the interest of strangers, except with a view to some reciprocal advantage, which they had no hope of obtaining but by such a performance. Now as it frequently happens, that these mutual performances cannot be finish’d at the same instant, ’tis necessary, that one party be contented to remain in uncertainty, and depend upon the gratitude of the other for a return of kindness. But so much corruption is there among men, that, generally speaking, this becomes but a slender security; and as the benefactor is here suppos’d to bestow his favours with a view to self-interest, this both takes off from the obligation, and sets an example of selfishness, which is the true <OPB num="108"/>mother of ingratitude. Were we, therefore, to follow the natural course of our passions and inclinations, we shou’d perform but few actions for the advantage of others, from disinterested views; because we are naturally very limited in our kindness and affection: And we shou’d perform as few of that kind, out of <MPB ed="SBN" num="520"/>a regard to interest; because we cannot depend upon their gratitude. Here then is the mutual commerce of good offices in a manner lost among mankind, and every one reduc’d to his own skill and industry for his well-being and subsistence. The invention of the law of nature, concerning the <em>stability</em> of possession, has already render’d men tolerable to each other; that of the <em>transference</em> of property and possession by consent has begun to render them mutually advantageous: But still these <del>laws of nature</del><ins comment="originally 'laws of nature'; manuscript deletion">laws</ins>, however strictly observ’d, are not sufficient to render them so serviceable to each other, as by nature they are fitted to become. Tho’ possession be <em>stable</em>, men may often reap but small advantage from it, while they are possess’d of a greater quantity of any species of goods than they have occasion for, and at the same time suffer by the want of others. The <em>transference</em> of property, which is the proper remedy <OPB num="109"/>for this inconvenience, cannot remedy it entirely; because it can only take place with regard to such objects as are <em>present</em> and <em>individual</em>, but not to such as are <em>absent</em> or <em>general</em>. One cannot transfer the property of a particular house, twenty leagues distant; because the consent cannot be attended with delivery, which is a requisite circumstance. Neither can one transfer the property of ten bushels of corn, or five hogsheads of wine, by the mere expression and consent; because these are only general terms, and have no direct relation to any particular heap of corn, or barrels of wine. Besides, the commerce of mankind is not confin’d to the barter of commodities, but may extend to services and actions, which we may exchange to our mutual interest and advantage. Your corn is ripe to-day; mine will be so to-morrow. ’Tis profitable for us both, that I shou’d labour with you to-day, and that you shou’d aid me to-morrow. I have no kindness for you, and know you have as little for me. I will not, therefore, take any pains upon your account; and should I labour with you upon my own account, in expectation of a return, I know I shou’d be disappointed, and that I shou’d in vain depend upon <MPB ed="SBN" num="521"/>your gratitude. Here then I <OPB num="110"/>leave you to labour alone: You treat me in the same manner. The seasons change; and both of us lose our harvests for want of mutual confidence and security.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.9"><para><sc>All</sc> this is the effect of the natural and inherent principles and passions of human nature; and as these passions and principles are inalterable, it may be thought, that our conduct, which depends on them, must be so too, and that ’twou’d be in vain, either for moralists or politicians, to tamper with us, or attempt to change the usual course of our actions, with a view to public interest. And indeed, did the success of their designs depend upon their success in correcting the selfishness and ingratitude of men, they wou’d never make any progress, unless aided by omnipotence, which is alone able to new-mould the human mind, and change its character in such fundamental articles. All they can pretend to, is, to give a new direction to those natural passions, and teach us that we can better satisfy our appetites in an oblique and artificial manner, than by their headlong and impetuous motion. Hence I learn to do a service to another, without bearing him any real kindness; because I forsee, that he will return my service, in expectation of another of the same <OPB num="111"/>kind, and in order to maintain the same correspondence of good offices with me or with others. And accordingly, after I have serv’d him, and he is in possession of the advantage arising from my action, he is induc’d to perform his part, as foreseeing the consequences of his refusal.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.10"><para><sc>But</sc> tho’ this self-interested commerce of men begins to take place, and to predominate in society, it does not entirely abolish the more generous and noble intercourse of friendship and good offices.

In order, therefore, to distinguish those two different sorts of commerce, the interested and the dis<MPB ed="SBN" num="522"/>interested, there is a <em>certain form of words</em> invented for the former, by which we bind ourselves to the performance of any action. This form of words constitutes what we call a <em>promise</em>, which is the sanction of the interested commerce of mankind. When a man says <em>he promises any thing</em>, he in effect expresses a <em>resolution</em> of performing it; and along with that, by making use of this <em>form of words</em>, <OPB num="112"/>subjects himself to the penalty of never being trusted again in case of failure. A resolution is the natural act of the mind, which promises express: But were there no more than a resolution in the case, promises wou’d only declare our former motives, and wou’d not create any new motive or obligation. They are the conventions of men, which create a new motive, when experience has taught us, that human affairs wou’d be conducted much more for mutual advantage, were there certain <em>symbols</em> or <em>signs</em> instituted, by which we might give each other security of our conduct in any particular incident. After these signs are instituted, whoever uses them is immediately bound by his interest to execute his engagements, and must never expect to be trusted any more, if he refuse to perform what he promis’d.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.11"><para><sc>Nor</sc> is that knowledge, which is requisite to make mankind sensible of this interest in the <em>institution</em> and <em>observance</em> of promises, to be esteem’d superior to the capacity of human nature, however savage and uncultivated. There needs but a very little practice of the world, to make us perceive all these consequences and advantages. The shortest experience of society discovers them to every mortal; and when each individual perceives <OPB num="113"/>the same sense of interest in all his fellows, he immediately performs his part of any contract, as being assur’d, that they will not be wanting in theirs. All of them, by concert, enter into a scheme of actions, calculated for common benefit, and agree to be true to their word; nor is there any thing requisite to form this concert or convention, but that every one have a sense of interest in the faithful fulfilling of engagements, and express that sense to other <MPB ed="SBN" num="523"/>members of the society. This immediately causes that interest to operate upon them; and interest is the <em>first</em> obligation to the performance of promises.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.12"><para><sc>Afterwards</sc> a sentiment of morals concurs with interest, and becomes a new obligation upon mankind. This sentiment of morality, in the performance of promises, arises from the same principles as that in the abstinence from the property of others. <em>Public interest</em>, <em>education</em>, and <em>the artifices of politicians</em>, have the same effect in both cases. The difficulties, that occur to us, in supposing a moral obligation to attend promises, we either surmount or elude. For instance; the expression of a resolution is not commonly suppos’d to be obligatory; and we cannot readily conceive how the <OPB num="114"/>making use of a certain form of words shou’d be able to cause any material difference. Here, therefore, we <em>feign</em> a new act of the mind, which we call the <em>willing</em> an obligation; and on this we suppose the morality to depend. But we have prov’d already, that there is no such act of the mind, and consequently that promises impose no natural obligation.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.13"><para><sc>To</sc> confirm this, we may subjoin some other reflections concerning that will, which is suppos’d to enter into a promise, and to cause its obligation. ’Tis evident, that the will alone is never suppos’d to cause the obligation, but must be express’d by words or signs, in order to impose a tye upon any man. The expression being once brought in as subservient to the will, soon becomes the principal part of the promise; nor will a man be less bound by his word, tho’ he secretly give a different direction to his intention, and with-hold himself both from a resolution, and from willing an obligation. But tho’ the expression makes on most occasions the whole of the promise, yet it does not always so; and one, who shou’d make use of any expression, of which he knows not the meaning, and which he uses without any intention of binding himself, wou’d not <OPB num="115"/>certainly be bound by it. Nay, tho’ he knows its meaning, yet if he uses it in jest only, and <MPB ed="SBN" num="524"/>with such signs as shew evidently he has no serious intention of binding himself, he wou’d not lie under any obligation of performance; but ’tis necessary, that the words be a perfect expression of the will, without any contrary signs. Nay, even this we must not carry so far as to imagine, that one, whom, by our quickness of understanding, we conjecture, from certain signs, to have an intention of deceiving us, is not bound by his expression or verbal promise, if we accept of it; but must limit this conclusion to those cases, where the signs are of a different kind from those of deceit. All these contradictions are easily accounted for, if the obligation of promises be merely a human invention for the convenience of society; but will never be explain’d, if it be something <em>real</em> and <em>natural</em>, arising from any action of the mind or body.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.14"><para><sc>I shall</sc> farther observe, that since every new promise imposes a new obligation of morality on the person who promises, and since this new obligation arises from his will; ’tis one of the most mysterious and incomprehensible operations that can possibly be imagin’d, and may even be compar’d to  <OPB num="116"/><em>transubstantiation</em>, or <em>holy orders</em><footnote num="78" sym="a"/>, where a certain form of words, along with a certain intention, changes entirely the nature of an external object, and even of a human creature. But tho’ these mysteries be so far alike, ’tis very remarkable, that they differ widely in other particulars, and that this difference may be regarded as a strong proof of the difference of their origins. As the obligation of promises is an invention for the interest of society, ’tis warp’d into as many different forms as that interest requires, and even runs into direct contradictions, rather than lose sight of its object. But as those other monstrous doctrines are mere priestly inventions, and have no public interest in view, they are less disturb’d in their progress by new obstacles; and it must be own’d, that, after the first absurdity, <MPB ed="SBN" num="525"/>they follow more directly the current of reason and good sense. Theologians clearly perceiv’d, that the external form of words, being mere sound, require an intention to make them have any efficacy; and that this intention being once consider’d as arequisite circumstance, its absence must equally prevent the <OPB num="117"/>effect, whether avow’d or conceal’d, whether sincere or deceitful. Accordingly they have commonly determin’d, that the intention of the priest makes the sacrament, and that when he secretly withdraws his intention, he is highly criminal in himself; but still destroys the baptism, or communion, or holy orders. The terrible consequences of this doctrine were not able to hinder its taking place; as the inconvenience of a similar doctrine, with regard to promises, have prevented that doctrine from establishing itself. Men are always more concern’d about the present life than the future; and are apt to think the smallest evil, which regards the former, more important than the greatest, which regards the latter.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.5.15"><para><sc>We</sc> may draw the same conclusion, concerning the origin of promises, from the <em>force</em>, which is suppos’d to invalidate all contracts, and to free us from their obligation. Such a principle is a proof, that promises have no natural obligation, and are mere artificial contrivances for the convenience and advantage of society. If we consider aright of the matter, force is not essentially different from any other motive of hope or fear, which may induce us to engage our word, and lay ourselves under any obliga<OPB num="118"/>tion. A man, dangerously wounded, who promises a competent sum to a surgeon to cure him, wou’d certainly be bound to performance; tho’ the case be not so much different from that of one, who promises a sum to a robber, as to produce so great a difference in our sentiments of morality, if these sentiments were not built entirely on public interest and convenience.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="T 3.2.6.1"><para><ac><dc>W</dc>e</ac> have now run over the three fundamental laws of nature, <em>that of the stability of possession</em>, <em>of its transference by consent</em>, and <em>of the performance of promises</em>. ’Tis on the strict observance of those three laws, that the peace and security of human society entirely depend; nor is there any possibility of establishing a good correspondence among men, where these are neglected. Society is absolutely necessary for the well-being of men; and these are as necessary to the support of society. Whatever restraint they may impose on the passions of men, they are the real offspring of <OPB num="119"/>those passions, and are only a more artful and more refin’d way of satisfying them. Nothing is more vigilant and inventive than our passions; and nothing is more obvious, than the convention for the observance of these rules. Nature has, therefore, trusted this affair entirely to the conduct of men, and has not plac’d in the mind any peculiar original principles, to determine us to a set of actions, into which the other principles of our frame and constitution were sufficient to lead us. And to convince us the more fully of this truth, we may here stop a moment, and from a review of the preceding reasonings may draw some new arguments, to prove that those laws, however necessary, are entirely artificial, and of human invention; and consequently that justice is an artificial, and not a natural virtue.<br/></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.6.2"><para>I. <sc>The</sc> first argument I shall make use of is deriv’d from the vulgar definition of justice. Justice is commonly defin’d to be <em>a constant and perpetual will of giving every one his due</em>. In this definition ’tis supposed, that there are such things as right and property, independent of justice, and antecedent to it; and that they wou’d have subsisted, tho’ men had never <MPB ed="SBN" num="527"/>dreamt of prac<OPB num="120"/>tising such a virtue. I have already observ’d, in a cursory manner, the fallacy of this opinion, and shall here continue to open up a little more distinctly my sentiments on that subject.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.6.3"><para><sc>I shall</sc> begin with observing, that this quality, which we call <em>property</em>, is like many of the imaginary qualities of the <em>peripatetic</em> philosophy, and vanishes upon a more accurate inspection into the subject, when consider’d a-part from our moral sentiments. ’Tis evident property does not consist in any of the sensible qualities of the object. For these may continue invariably the same, while the property changes. Property, therefore, must consist in some relation of the object. But ’tis not in its relation with regard to other external and inanimate objects. For these may also continue invariably the same, while the property changes. This quality, therefore, consists in the relations of objects to intelligent and rational beings. But ’tis not the external and corporeal relation, which forms the essence of property. For that relation may be the same betwixt inanimate objects, or with regard to brute creatures; tho’ in those cases it forms no property. ’Tis, therefore, in some internal relation, that the property consists; that is, <OPB num="121"/>in some influence, which the external relations of the object have on the mind and actions. Thus the external relation, which we call <em>occupation</em> or first possession, is not of itself imagin’d to be the property of the object, but only to cause its property. Now ’tis evident, this external relation causes nothing in external objects, and has only an influence on the mind, by giving us a sense of duty in abstaining from that object, and in restoring it to the first possessor. These actions are properly what we call <em>justice</em>; and consequently ’tis on that virtue that the nature of property depends, and not the virtue on the property.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.6.4"><para><sc>If</sc> any one, therefore, wou’d assert, that justice is a natural virtue, and injustice a natural vice, he must assert, that abstracting from the notions of <em>property</em>, and <em>right</em> and <em>obligation</em>, a certain conduct and train of actions, in certain <MPB ed="SBN" num="528"/>external relations of objects, has naturally a moral beauty or deformity, and causes an original pleasure or uneasiness. Thus the restoring a man’s goods to him is consider’d as virtuous, not because nature has annex’d a certain sentiment of pleasure to such a conduct, with regard to the property of others, but because she has annex’d that sentiment to such a conduct, with <OPB num="122"/>regard to those external objects, of which others have had the first or long possession, or which they have receiv’d by the consent of those, who have had first or long possession. If nature has given us no such sentiment, there is not, naturally, nor antecedent to human conventions, any such thing as property. Now, tho’ it seems sufficiently evident, in this dry and accurate consideration of the present subject, that nature has annex’d no pleasure or sentiment of approbation to such a conduct; yet that I may leave as little room for doubt as possible, I shall subjoin a few more arguments to confirm my opinion.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.6.5"><para><em>First</em>, If nature had given us a pleasure of this kind, it wou’d have been as evident and discernible as on every other occasion; nor shou’d we have found any difficulty to perceive, that the consideration of such actions, in such a situation, gives a certain pleasure and <ins comment="manuscript addition">a</ins> sentiment of approbation. We shou’d not have been oblig’d to have recourse to notions of property in the definition of justice, and at the same time makeuse of the notions of justice in the definition of property. This deceitful method of reasoning is a plain proof, that there are contain’d in the subject some obscurities and difficulties, <OPB num="123"/>which we are not able to surmount, and which we desire to evade by this artifice.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.6.6"><para><em>Secondly</em>, Those rules, by which <del>properties, rights, and obligations</del><ins comment="originally 'properties, rights, and obligations'; manuscript alteration">property, right, and obligation</ins> are determin’d, have in them no marks of a natural origin, but many of artifice and contrivance. They are too numerous to have proceeded from nature: They are changeable by human laws: And have all of them a direct and evident tendency to public good, and the support of <del>civil society</del><ins comment="originall 'civil society'; manuscript deletion">society</ins>. This last circumstance is remarkable upon two <MPB ed="SBN" num="529"/>accounts. <em>First</em>, because, tho’ the cause of the establishment of these laws had been a <em>regard</em> for the public good, as much as the public good is their natural tendency, they wou’d still have been artificial, as being purposely contriv’d and directed to a certain end. <em>Secondly</em>, because, if men had been endow’d with such a strong regard for public good, they wou’d never have restrain’d themselves by these rules; so that the laws of justice arise from natural principles in a manner still more oblique and artificial. ’Tis self-love which is their real origin; and as the self-love of one person is naturally contrary to that of another, these several interested passions are oblig’d to adjust themselves after such a manner as to concur in some system <OPB num="124"/>of conduct and behaviour. This system, therefore, comprehending the interest of each individual, is of course advantageous to the public; tho’ it be not intended for that purpose by the inventors.<br/></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.6.7"><para>II. <sc>In</sc> the second place we may observe, that all kinds of vice and virtue run insensibly into each other, and may approach by such imperceptible degrees as will make it very difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to determine when the one ends, and the other begins; and from this observation we may derive a new argument for the foregoing principle. For whatever may be the case, with regard to all kinds of vice and virtue, ’tis certain, that rights, and obligations, and property, admit of no such insensible gradation, but that a man either has a full and perfect property, or none at all; and is either entirely oblig’d to perform any action, or lies under no manner of obligation. However civil laws may talk of a perfect <em>dominion</em>, and of an imperfect, ’tis easy to observe, that this arises from a fiction, which has no foundation in reason, and can never enter into our notions of natural justice and equity. A man that hires a horse, tho’ but for a day, has as full a right to <OPB num="125"/>make use of it for that time, as he whom we call its proprietor has to make use of it any other day; and ’tis evident, that however the use may be <MPB ed="SBN" num="530"/>bounded in time or degree, the right itself is not susceptible of any such gradation, but is absolute and entire, so far as it extends. Accordingly we may observe, that this right both arises and perishes in an instant; and that a man entirely acquires the property of any object by occupation, or the consent of the proprietor; and loses it by his own consent; without any of that insensible gradation, which is remarkable in other qualities and relations. Since, therefore, this is the case with regard to property, and rights, and obligations, I ask, how it stands with regard to justice and injustice? After whatever manner you answer this question, you run into inextricable difficulties. If you reply, that justice and injustice admit of degree, and run insensibly into each other, you expressly contradict the foregoing position, that obligation and property are not susceptible of such a gradation. These depend entirely upon justice and injustice, and follow them in all their variations. Where the justice is entire, the property is also entire: Where the justice is imperfect, the property must also be imperfect. <OPB num="126"/>And <em>vice versa</em>, if the property admit of no such variations, they must also be incompatible with justice. If you assent, therefore, to this last proposition, and assert, that justice and injustice are not susceptible of degrees, you in effect assert, that they are not <em>naturally</em> either vicious or virtuous; since vice and virtue, moral good and evil, and indeed all <em>natural</em> qualities, run insensibly into each other, and are, on many occasions, undistinguishable.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.6.8"><para><sc>And</sc> here it may be worth while to observe, that tho’ abstract reasoning, and the general maxims of philosophy and law establish this position, <em>that property, and right, and obligation admit not of degrees</em>, yet in our common and negligent way of thinking, we find great difficulty to entertain that opinion, and do even <em>secretly</em> embrace the contrary principle. An object must either be in the possession of one person or another. An action must either be perform’d or not. The necessity there is of choosing one side in these <MPB ed="SBN" num="531"/>dilemmas, and the impossibility there often is of finding any just medium, oblige us, when we reflect on the matter, to acknowledge, that all property and obligations are entire. But on the other hand, when we consider the origin of property and ob<OPB num="127"/>ligation, and find that they depend on public utility, and sometimes on the <del>propensity</del><ins comment="originall 'propensity'; ERRATA and manuscript alteration">propensities</ins> of the imagination, which are seldom entire on any side; we are naturally inclin’d to imagine, that these moral relations admit of an insensible gradation. Hence it is, that in references, where the consent of the parties leave the referees entire masters of the subject, they commonly discover so much equity and justice on both sides, as induces them to strike a medium, and divide the difference betwixt the parties. Civil judges, who have not this liberty, but are oblig’d to give a decisive sentence on some one side, are often at a loss how to determine, and are necessitated to proceed on the most frivolous reasons in the world. Half rights and obligations, which seem so natural in common life, are perfect absurdities in their tribunal; for which reason they are often oblig’d to take half arguments for whole ones, in order to terminate the affair one way or other.<br/></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.6.9"><para>III. <sc>The</sc> third argument of this kind I shall make use of may be explain’d thus. If we consider the ordinary course of human actions, we shall find, that the mind restrains not itself by any general and universal rules; but acts on most occasions as it is <OPB num="128"/>determin’d by its present motives and inclination. As each action is a particular individual event, it must proceed from particular principles, and from our immediate situation within ourselves, and with respect to the rest of the universe. If on some occasions we extend our motives beyond those very circumstances, which gave rise to them, and form something like <em>general rules</em> for our conduct, ’tis easy to observe, that these rules are not perfectly inflexible, but allow of many exceptions. Since, therefore, this is the ordinary course of human actions, we may conclude, <MPB ed="SBN" num="532"/>that the laws of justice, being universal and perfectly inflexible, can never be deriv’d from nature, nor be the immediate offspring of any natural motive or inclination. No action can be either morally good or evil, unless there be some natural passion or motive to impel us to it, or deter us from it; and ’tis evident, that the morality must be susceptible of all the same variations, which are natural to the passion. Here are two persons, who dispute for an estate; of whom one is rich, a fool, and a batchelor; the other poor, a man of sense, and has a numerous family: The first is my enemy; the second my friend. Whether I be actuated in this affair <OPB num="129"/>by a view to public or private interest, by friendship or enmity, I must be induc’d to do my utmost to procure the estate to the latter. Nor wou’d any consideration of the right and property of the persons be able to restrain me, were I actuated only by natural motives, without any combination or convention with others. For as all property depends on morality; and as all morality depends on the ordinary course of our passions and actions; and as these again are only directed by particular motives; ’tis evident, such a partial conduct must be suitable to the strictest morality, and cou’d never be a violation of property. Were men, therefore, to take the liberty of acting with regard to the laws of society, as they do in every other affair, they wou’d conduct themselves, on most occasions, by particular judgments, and wou’d take into consideration the characters and circumstances of the persons, as well as the general nature of the question. But ’tis easy to observe, that this wou’d produce an infinite confusion in human society, and that the avidity and partiality of men wou’d quickly bring disorder into the world, if not restrain’d by some general and inflexible principles. ’Twas, therefore, with a view to this inconvenience, <OPB num="130"/>that men have establish’d those principles, and have agreed to restrain themselves by general rules, which are unchangeable by spite and favour, and by particular views of private or public interest. These rules, then, are artificially invented for a certain <MPB ed="SBN" num="533"/>purpose, and are contrary to the common principles of human nature, which accommodate themselves to circumstances, and have no stated invariable method of operation.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.6.10"><para><sc>Nor</sc> do I perceive how I can easily be mistaken in this matter. I see evidently, that when any man imposes on himself general inflexible rules in his conduct with others, he considers certain objects as their property, which he supposes to be sacred and inviolable. But no proposition can be more evident, than that property is perfectly unintelligible without first supposing justice and injustice; and that these <del>virtues and vices</del><ins comment="originally 'virtues and vices'; manuscript alteration">moral duties</ins> are as unintelligible, unless we have motives, independent of the morality, to impel us to just actions, and deter us from unjust ones. Let those motives, therefore, be what they will, they must accommodate themselves to circumstances, and must admit of all the variations, which human affairs, in their incessant revolutions, are susceptible of. They are consequently a very improper foundation <OPB num="131"/>for such rigid inflexible rules as the laws of nature; and ’tis evident these laws can only be deriv’d from human conventions, when men have perceiv’d the disorders that result from following their natural and variable principles.<br/></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.6.11"><para><sc>Upon</sc> the whole, then, we are to consider this distinction betwixt justice and injustice, as having two different foundations, <em>viz.</em> that of <del>interest</del><ins comment="originally 'interest'; manuscript addition"><em>self-interest</em></ins>, when men observe, that ’tis impossible to live in society without restraining themselves by certain rules; and that of <em>morality</em>, when this interest is once observ’d <ins comment="manuscript addition">to be common to all mankind</ins>, and men receive a pleasure from the view of such actions as tend to the peace of society, and an uneasiness from such as are contrary to it. ’Tis the voluntary convention and artifice of men, which makes the first interest take place; and therefore those laws of justice are so far to be consider’d as <em>artificial</em>. After that interest is once establish’d and acknowledg’d, the sense of morality in the observance of these rules follows <em>naturally</em>, and of itself; tho’ ’tis certain, that it is also augmented by a new <em>artifice</em>, and that the public instructions <MPB ed="SBN" num="534"/>of politicians, and the private education of parents, contribute to the giving <ins comment="ERRATA and manuscript addition">us</ins> a sense of <OPB num="132"/>honour and duty in the strict regulation of our actions with regard to the properties of others.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.7"><title><h3><wide>SEC</wide>T.<wide> </wide>VII.</h3><h4><em>Of the origin of government.</em></h4></title></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.7.1"><para><ac><dc>N</dc>othing</ac> is more certain, than that men are, in a great measure, govern’d by interest, and that even when they extend their concern beyond themselves, ’tis not to any great distance; nor is it usual for them, in common life, to look farther than their nearest friends and acquaintance. ’Tis no less certain, that ’tis impossible for men to consult their interest in so effectual a manner, as by an universal and inflexible observance of the rules of justice, by which alone they can preserve society, and keep themselves from falling into that wretched and savage condition, which is commonly represented as the <em>state of nature</em>. And as this interest, which all men have in the upholding of society, and the observation of the rules of justice, is great, so is it palpable and evident, even to the most rude and uncultivated of human race; and ’tis almost impossible for <OPB num="133"/>any one, who has had experience of society, to be mistaken in this particular. Since, therefore, men are so sincerely attach’d to their interest, and their interest is so much concern’d in the observance of justice, and this interest is so certain and avow’d; it may be ask’d, how any disorder can ever arise in society, and what principle there is in human nature so <em>powerful</em> as to overcome so strong a passion, or so <em>violent</em> as to obscure so clear a knowledge?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.7.2"><para><sc>It</sc> has been observ’d, in treating of the passions, that men are mightily govern’d by the imagination, and proportion their affections more to the light, under which any object appears to them, than to its real and intrinsic value. What strikes upon them with a strong and lively idea commonly <MPB ed="SBN" num="535"/>prevails above what lies in a more obscure light; and it must be a great superiority of value, that is able to compensate this advantage. Now as every thing, that is contiguous to us, either in space or time, strikes upon us with such an idea, it has a proportional effect on the will and passions, and commonly operates with more force than any object, that lies in a more distant and obscure light. Tho’ we may be fully convinc’d, that the latter object excels the former, we are not <OPB num="134"/>able to regulate our actions by this judgment; but yield to the sollicitations of our passions, which always plead in favour of whatever is near and contiguous.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.7.3"><para><sc>This</sc> is the reason why men so often act in contradiction to their known interest; and in particular why they prefer any trivial advantage, that is present, to the maintenance of order in society, which so much depends on the observance of justice. The consequences of every breach of equity seem to lie very remote, and are not able to counter-ballance any immediate advantage, that may be reap’d from it. They are, however, never the less real for being remote; and as all men are, in some degree, subject to the same weakness, it necessarily happens, that the violations of equity must become very frequent in society, and the commerce of men, by that means, be render’d very dangerous and uncertain. You have the same propension, that I have, in favour of what is contiguous above what is remote. You are, therefore, naturally carried to commit acts of injustice as well as me. Your example both pushes me forward in this way by imitation, and also affords me a new reason for any breach of equity, by shewing me, that I should be the cully of my integrity, if I <OPB num="135"/>alone shou’d impose on myself a severe restraint amidst the licentiousness of others.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.7.4"><para><sc>This</sc> quality, therefore, of human nature, not only is very dangerous to society, but also seems, on a cursory view, to be incapable of any remedy. The remedy can only come from the consent of men; and if men be incapable of themselves to prefer remote to contiguous, they will never <MPB ed="SBN" num="536"/>consent to any thing which wou’d oblige them to such a choice, and contradict, in so sensible a manner, their natural principles and propensities. Whoever chuses the means, chuses also the end; and if it be impossible for us to prefer what is remote, ’tis equally impossible for us to submit to any necessity, which wou’d oblige us to such a method of acting.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.7.5"><para><sc>But</sc> here ’tis observable, that this infirmity of human nature becomes a remedy to itself, and that <del>we provide</del><ins comment="originally 'we provide'; manuscript alteration (actually reads 'the provisions we make', changed to singular to agree with 'proceeds' in the next alteration)">the provision we make</ins> against our negligence about remote objects, <del>merely because we are naturally inclined</del><ins comment="originally 'merely because we are naturally inclined'; manuscript alteration">proceeds merely from our natural inclination</ins> to that negligence. When we consider any objects at a distance, all their minute distinctions vanish, and we always give the preference to whatever is in itself preferable, without considering its situation and circumstances. This gives rise to what in an improper sense we <OPB num="136"/>call <em>reason</em>, which is a principle, that is often contradictory to those propensities that display themselves upon the approach of the object. In reflecting on any action, which I am to perform a twelve-month hence, I always resolve to prefer the greater good, whether at that time it will be more contiguous or remote; nor does any difference in that particular make a difference in my present intentions and resolutions. My distance from the final determination makes all those minute differences vanish, nor am I affected by any thing, but the general and more discernable qualities of good and evil. But on my nearer approach, those circumstances, which I at first over-look’d, begin to appear, and have an influence on my conduct and affections. A new inclination to the present good springs up, and makes it difficult for me to adhere inflexibly to my first purpose and resolution. This natural infirmity I may very much regret, and I may endeavour, by all possible means, to free my self from it.

<dhot id="T 3.2.7.6"><para><sc>The</sc> only difficulty, therefore, is to find out this expedient, by which men cure their natural weakness, and lay themselves under the necessity of observing the laws of justice and equity, notwithstanding their violent propension to prefer contiguous to remote. ’Tis evident such a remedy can never be effectual without correcting this propensity; and as ’tis impossible to change or correct any thing material in our nature, the utmost we can do is to change our circumstances and situation, and render the observance of the laws of justice our nearest interest, and their violation our most remote. But this being impracticable with respect to all mankind, it can only take place with respect to a few, whom we thus immediately interest in the execution of justice. These are the persons, whom we call civil magistrates, kings and their ministers, our governors and rulers, who being indifferent persons to the greatest part of the state, have no interest, or but a remote one, in any act of injustice; and being satisfied with their present condition, and with their part in society, have an immediate interest in every execution of justice, which is so necessary to the upholding of <OPB num="138"/>society. Here then is the origin of civil government and <del>society</del><ins comment="originally 'society'; manuscript alteration">allegiance</ins>. Men are not able radically to cure, either in themselves or others, that narrowness of soul, which makes them prefer the present to the remote. They cannot change their natures. All they can do is to change their situation, and render the observance of justice the immediate interest of some particular persons, and its violation their more remote. These persons, then, are not only induc’d to observe those rules in their own conduct, but also to constrain others to a like regularity, and inforce the dictates of equity thro’ the whole society. And if it be necessary, they may also interest others more immediately in the execution of justice, and create a number of officers, civil and military, to assist them in their government.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.7.7"><para><sc>But</sc> this execution of justice, tho’ the principal, is not the <MPB ed="SBN" num="538"/>only advantage of government. As <del>the violent passions hinder</del><ins comment="originally 'the violent passions hinder'; ERRATA and manuscript alteration">violent passion hinders</ins> men from seeing distinctly the interest they have in an equitable behaviour towards others; so it hinders them from seeing that equity itself, and gives them a remarkable partiality in their own favours. This inconvenience is corrected in the same manner as that above-mention’d. The same persons, <OPB num="139"/>who execute the laws of justice, will also decide all controversies concerning them; and being indifferent to the greatest part of the society, will decide them more equitably than every one wou’d in his own case.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.7.8"><para><sc>By</sc> means of these two advantages, in the <em>execution</em> and <em>decision</em> of justice, men acquire a security against each <del>others</del><ins comment="originally 'others'">other’s</ins> weakness and passion, as well as against their own, and under the shelter of their governors, begin to taste at ease the sweets of society and mutual assistance. But government extends farther its beneficial influence; and not contented to protect men in those conventions they make for their mutual interest, it often obliges them to make such conventions, and forces them to seek their own advantage, by a concurrence in some common end or purpose. There is no quality in human nature, which causes more fatal errors in our conduct, than that which leads us to prefer whatever is present to the distant and remote, and makes us desire objects more according to their situation than their intrinsic value. Two neighbours may agree to drain a meadow, which they possess in common; because ’tis easy for them to know each <del>others</del><ins comment="originally 'others'">other’s</ins> mind; and each must perceive, that the immediate consequence of his failing in his part, is, the <OPB num="140"/>abandoning the whole project. But ’tis very difficult, and indeed impossible, that a thousand persons shou’d agree in any such action; it being difficult for them to concert so complicated a design, and still more difficult for them to execute it; while each seeks a pretext to free himself of the trouble and expence, and wou’d lay the whole burden on others. Political society easily remedies both these inconveniences. Magistrates find an immediate interest in the interest of any considerable part of their <MPB ed="SBN" num="539"/>subjects. They need consult no body but themselves to form any scheme for the promoting of that interest. And as the failure of any one piece in the execution is connected, tho’ not immediately, with the failure of the whole, they prevent that failure, because they find no interest in it, either immediate or remote. Thus bridges are built; harbours open’d; ramparts rais’d; canals form’d; fleets equip’d; and armies disciplin’d; every where, by the care of government, which, tho’ compos’d of men subject to all human infirmities, becomes, by one of the finest and most subtle inventions imaginable, a composition, <del>which</del><ins comment="originally 'which'; manuscript alteration">that</ins> is, in some measure, exempted from all these infirmities.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="T 3.2.8.1"><para><ac><dc>T</dc>hough</ac> government be an invention very advantageous, and even in some circumstances absolutely necessary to mankind; it is not necessary in all circumstances, nor is it impossible for men to preserve society for some time, without having recourse to such an invention. Men, ’tis true, are always much inclin’d to prefer present interest to distant and remote; nor is it easy for them to resist the temptation of any advantage, that they may immediately enjoy, in apprehension of an evil, that lies at a distance from them: But still this weakness is less conspicuous, where the possessions, and the pleasures of life are few, and of little value, as they always are in the infancy of society. An <em>Indian</em> is but little tempted to dispossess another of his hut, or to steal his bow, as being already provided of the same advantages; and as to any superior fortune, which may attend one above another in hunting and fishing, ’tis only casual and temporary, and will have but small tendency <OPB num="142"/>to disturb society. And so far am I from thinking with some philosophers, that men are utterly incapable of society without government, that I assert the <MPB ed="SBN" num="540"/>first rudiments of government to arise from quarrels, not among men of the same society, but among those of different societies. A less degree of riches will suffice to this latter effect, than is requisite for the former. Men fear nothing from public war and violence but the resistance they meet with, which, because they share it in common, seems less terrible; and because it comes from strangers, seems less pernicious in its consequences, than when they are expos’d singly against one whose commerce is advantageous to them, and without whose society ’tis impossible they can subsist. Now foreign war to a society without government necessarily produces civil war. Throw any considerable goods among men, they instantly fall a quarrelling, while each strives to get possession of what pleases him, without regard to the consequences. In a foreign war the most considerable of all goods, life and limbs, are at stake; and as every one shuns dangerous <del>ports</del><ins comment="originally 'ports'; manuscript alteration">posts</ins>, seizes the best arms, seeks excuse for the slightest wounds, <del>the laws</del><ins comment="originally 'the laws'; manuscript alteration">the rules of society</ins>, which may be well enough observ’d, while men were calm, can <OPB num="143"/>now no longer take place, when they are in such commotion.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.8.2"><para><sc>This</sc> we find verified in the <em>American</em> tribes, where men live in concord and amity among themselves without any establish’d government; and never pay submission to any of their fellows, except in time of war, when their captain enjoys a shadow of authority, which he loses after their return from the field, and the establishment of peace with the neighbouring tribes. This authority, however, instructs them in the advantages of government, and teaches them to have recourse to it, when either by the pillage of war, by commerce, or by any fortuitous inventions, their riches and possessions have become so considerable as to make them forget, on every emergence, the interest they have in the preservation of peace and justice. Hence we may give a plausible reason, among others, why all governments are at first monarchical, without any mixture and variety; and why republics arise only from the abuses of monarchy and despotic power. Camps are the <MPB ed="SBN" num="541"/>true mothers of cities; and as war cannot be administred, by reason of the suddenness of every exigency, without some authority in a single person, the same kind of authority naturally <OPB num="144"/>takes place in that civil government, which succeeds the military. And this reason I take to be more natural, than the common one deriv’d from patriarchal government, or the authority of a father, which is said first to take place in one family, and to accustom the members of it to the government of a single person. The state of society without government is one of the most natural states of men, and <del>must</del><ins comment="originally 'must'; manuscript alteration">may</ins> subsist with the conjunction of many families, and long after the first generation.

<dhot id="T 3.2.8.3"><para><sc>But</sc> tho’ it be possible for men to maintain a small uncultivated society without government, ’tis impossible they shou’d maintain a society of any kind without justice, and the observance of those three fundamental laws concerning the stability of possession, its translation by consent, and the performance of promises. These are, therefore, antecedent to government, and are suppos’d to impose an obligation before the <OPB num="145"/>duty of allegiance to civil magistrates has once been thought of. Nay, I shall go farther, and assert, that government, <em>upon its first establishment</em>, wou’d naturally be suppos’d to derive its obligation from those laws of nature, and, in particular, from that concerning the performance of promises. When men have once perceiv’d the necessity of government to maintain peace, and execute justice, they wou’d naturally assemble together, wou’d chuse magistrates, determine their power, and <em>promise</em> them obedience. As a promise is suppos’d to be a bond or security already in use, and attended with a moral obligation, ’tis to be consider’d as the original sanction of government, and as the source of the first obligation to obedience. This reasoning appears so natural, that <MPB ed="SBN" num="542"/>it has become the foundation of our fashionable system of politics, and is in a manner the creed of a party amongst us, who <del>pride</del><ins comment="originally 'pride'; manuscript alteration">value</ins> themselves, with reason, on the soundness of their philosophy, and their liberty of thought. <em>All men</em>, say they, <em>are born free and equal: Government and superiority can only be establish’d by consent: The consent of men, in establishing government, imposes on them a new obligation, unknown to the laws of nature. Men, therefore, are bound to obey their <OPB num="146"/>magistrates, only because they promise it</em>;<em> and if they had not given their word, either expressly or tacitly, to preserve allegiance, it would never have become a part of their moral duty</em>. This conclusion, however, when carried so far as to comprehend government in all its ages and situations, is entirely erroneous; and I maintain, that tho’ the duty of allegiance be at first grafted on the obligation of promises, and be for some time supported by that obligation, yet <del>it quickly</del><ins comment="originally 'it quickly'; manuscript alteration">as soon as the advantages of government are fully known and acknowledg’d, it immediately</ins> takes root of itself, and has an original obligation and authority, independent of all contracts. This is a principle of moment, which we must examine with care and attention, before we proceed any farther.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.8.4"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> reasonable for those philosophers, who assert justice to be a natural virtue, and antecedent to human conventions, to resolve all civil allegiance into the obligation of a promise, and assert that ’tis our own consent alone, which binds us to any submission to magistracy. For as all government is plainly an invention of men, and the origin of most governments is known in history, ’tis necessary to mount higher, in order to find the source of our political duties, if we wou’d assert them to have any <em>natural</em> obligation of morality. These phi<OPB num="147"/>losophers, therefore, quickly observe, that society is as antient as the human species, and those three fundamental laws of nature as antient as society: So that taking advantage of the antiquity, and obscure origin of these laws, they first deny them to be artificial and voluntary inventions of men, and then seek to ingraft on them those other duties, which are more plainly artificial. But being once undeceiv’d in this <MPB ed="SBN" num="543"/>particular, and having found that <em>natural</em>, as well as <em>civil</em> justice, derives its origin from human conventions, we shall quickly perceive, how fruitless it is to resolve the one into the other, and seek, in the laws of nature, a stronger foundation for our political duties than interest, and human conventions; while these laws themselves are built on the very same foundation. On which ever side we turn this subject, we shall find, that these two kinds of duty are exactly on the same footing, and have the same source both of their <em>first invention</em> and <em>moral obligation</em>. They are contriv’d to remedy like inconveniences, and acquire their moral sanction in the same manner, from their remedying those inconveniences. These are two points, which <del>we we</del><ins comment="originally 'we we'; manuscript deletion">we</ins> shall endeavour to prove as distinctly as possible.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.8.5"><para><sc>We</sc> have already shewn, that men <em>invented</em> the three fundamental laws of nature, when they observ’d the necessity of society to their mutual subsistance, and found, that ’twas impossible to maintain any correspondence together, without some restraint on their natural appetites. The same self-love, therefore, which renders men so incommodious to each other, taking a new and more convenient direction, produces the rules of justice, and is the <em>first</em> motive of their observance. But when men have observ’d, that tho’ the rules of justice be sufficient to maintain any society, yet ’tis impossible for them, of themselves, to observe those rules, in large and polish’d societies; they establish government, as a new invention to attain their ends, and preserve the old, or procure new advantages, by a more strict execution of justice. So far, therefore, our <em>civil</em> duties are connected with our <em>natural</em>, that the former are invented chiefly for the sake of the latter; and that the principal object of government is to constrain men to observe the laws of nature. In this respect, however, that law of nature, concerning the performance of promises, is only compriz’d along with the rest; and its exact observance is to be consider’d as an effect of the insti<OPB num="149"/>tution of government, and not the obedience to government as an effect of the obligation of a promise. Tho’ the object of our <MPB ed="SBN" num="544"/>civil duties be the enforcing of our natural, yet the<footnote num="79" sym="a"/> <em>first</em> motive of the invention, as well as performance of both, is nothing but self-interest: And since there is a separate interest in the obedience to government, from that in the performance of promises, we must also allow of a separate obligation. To obey the civil magistrate is requisite to preserve order and concord in society. To perform promises is requisite to beget mutual trust and confidence in the common offices of life. The ends, as well as the means, are perfectly distinct; nor is the one subordinate to the other.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.8.6"><para><sc>To</sc> make this more evident, let us consider, that men will often bind themselves by promises to the performance of what it wou’d have been their interest to perform, independent of these promises; as when they wou’d give others a fuller security, by super-adding a new obligation of interest to that which they formerly lay under. The interest in the performance of promises, besides its moral obligation, is general, avow’d, and of the last consequence in life. Other <OPB num="150"/>interests may be more particular and doubtful; and we are apt to entertain a greater suspicion, that men may indulge their humour, or passion, in acting contrary to them. Here, therefore, promises come naturally in play, and are often requir’d for fuller satisfaction and security. But supposing those other interests to be as general and avow’d as the interest in the performance of a promise, they will be regarded as on the same footing, and men will begin to repose the same confidence in them. Now this is exactly the case with regard to our civil duties, or obedience to the magistrate; without which no government cou’d subsist, nor any peace or order be maintain’d in large societies, where there are so many possessions on the one hand, and so many wants, real or imaginary, on the other. Our civil duties, therefore, must soon detach themselves from our promises, and acquire a separate force and influence. The interest in both is of the very same kind: ’Tis general, avow’d, and prevails in all <MPB ed="SBN" num="545"/>times and places. There is, then, no pretext of reason for founding the one upon the other; while each of them has a foundation peculiar to itself. We might as well resolve the obligation to abstain from the possessions of others, into <OPB num="151"/>the obligation of a promise, as that of allegiance. The interests are not more distinct in the one case than the other. A regard to property is not more necessary to natural society, than obedience is to civil society or government; nor is the former society more necessary to the being of mankind, than the latter to their well-being and happiness. In short, if the performance of promises be advantageous, so is obedience to government: If the former interest be general, so is the latter: If the one interest be obvious and avow’d, so is the other. And as these two rules are founded on like obligations of interest, each of them must have a peculiar authority, independent of the other.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.8.7"><para><sc>But</sc> ’tis not only the <em>natural</em> obligations of interest, which are distinct in promises and allegiance; but also the <em>moral</em> obligations of honour and conscience: Nor does the merit or demerit of the one depend in the least upon that of the other. And indeed, if we consider the close connexion there is betwixt the natural and moral obligations, we shall find this conclusion to be entirely unavoidable. Our interest is always engag’d on the side of obedience to magistracy; and there is nothing but a great present advantage, that can lead us to rebellion, <OPB num="152"/>by making us over-look the remote interest, which we have in the preserving of peace and order in society. But tho’ a present interest may thus blind us with regard to our own actions, it takes not place with regard to those of others; nor hinders them from appearing in their true colours, as highly prejudicial to <del>public interest, and to our own in particular</del><ins comment="originally 'public interest, and to our own in particular'; manuscript alteration">our own interest, or at least to that of the public, which we partake of by <em>sympathy</em></ins>. This naturally gives us an uneasiness, in considering such seditious and disloyal actions, and makes us attach to them the idea of vice and moral deformity. ’Tis the same principle, which causes us to disapprove of all kinds of private injustice, and in particular of the breach of pro<MPB ed="SBN" num="546"/>mises. We blame all treachery and breach of faith; because we consider, that the freedom and extent of human commerce depend entirely on a fidelity with regard to promises. We blame all disloyalty to magistrates; because we perceive, that the execution of justice, in the stability of possession, its translation by consent, and the performance of promises, is impossible, without submission to government. As there are here two interests entirely distinct from each other, they must give rise to two moral obligations, equally separate and independant. Tho’ there was no such thing as a promise in the world, go<OPB num="153"/>vernment wou’d still be necessary in all large and civiliz’d societies; and if promises had only their own proper obligation, without the separate sanction of government, they wou’d have but little efficacy in such societies. This separates the boundaries of our public and private duties, and shews that the latter are more dependant on the former, than the former on the latter. <em>Education</em>, and <em>the artifice of politicians</em>, concur <del>to bestow</del><ins comment="originally 'to bestow'; manuscript alteration">in bestowing</ins> a farther morality on loyalty, and <del>to brand</del><ins comment="originally 'to brand'; manuscript alteration">branding</ins> all rebellion with a greater degree of guilt and infamy. Nor is it a wonder, that politicians shou’d be very industrious in inculcating such notions, where their interest is so particularly concern’d.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.8.8"><para><sc>Lest</sc> those arguments shou’d not appear entirely conclusive (as I think they are) I shall have recourse to authority, and shall prove, from the universal consent of mankind, that the obligation of submission to government is not deriv’d from any promise of the subjects. Nor need any one wonder, that tho’ I have all along endeavour’d to establish my system on pure reason, and have scarce ever cited the judgment even of philosophers or historians on any article, I shou’d now appeal to popular authority, and oppose the sentiments of the rabble to any philoso<OPB num="154"/>phical reasoning. <del>But</del><ins comment="originally 'But'; ERRATA and manuscript alteration">For</ins> it must be observ’d, that the opinions of men, in this case, carry with them a peculiar authority, and are, in a great measure, infallible. The distinction of moral good and evil is founded on the pleasure or pain, which results from the view of any sentiment, or <MPB ed="SBN" num="547"/>character; and as that pleasure or pain cannot be unknown to the person who feels it, it follows,<footnote num="80" sym="a"/> that there is just so much vice or virtue in any character, as every one places in it, and that ’tis impossible in this particular we can ever be mistaken. And tho’ our judgments concerning the <em>origin</em> of any vice or virtue, be not so certain as those concerning their <em>degrees</em>; yet, since the question in this case regards not any philosophical origin of an obligation, but a plain matter of fact, ’tis not easily conceiv’d how we can fall into an error. A man, who acknowledges himself to be bound to another, for a certain sum, must certainly know whether it be by his own bond, or that of his father; whether it be of his mere good-will, or for money lent <OPB num="155"/>him; and under what conditions, and for what purposes he has bound himself. In like manner, it being certain, that there is a moral obligation to submit to government, because every one thinks so; it must be as certain, that this obligation arises not from a promise; since no one, whose judgment has not been led astray by too strict adherence to a system of philosophy, has ever yet dreamt of ascribing it to that origin. Neither magistrates nor subjects have form’d this idea of our civil duties.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.8.9"><para><sc>We</sc> find, that magistrates are so far from deriving their authority, and the obligation to obedience in their subjects, from the foundation of a promise or original contract, that they conceal, as far as possible, from their people, especially from the vulgar, that they have their origin from thence. Were this the sanction of government, our rulers wou’d never receive it tacitly, which is the utmost that can be pretended; since what is given tacitly and insensibly can never have such influence on mankind, as what is perform’d expressly and openly. A tacit promise is, where the will is signified by <MPB ed="SBN" num="548"/>other more diffuse signs than those of speech; but a will there must certainly be in the case, and that can never escape the person’s no<OPB num="156"/>tice, who exerted it, however silent or tacit. But were you to ask the far greatest part of the nation, whether they had ever consented to the authority of their rulers, or promis’d to obey them, they wou’d be inclin’d to think very strangely of you; and wou’d certainly reply, that the affair depended not on their consent, but that they were born to such an obedience. In consequence of this opinion, we frequently see them imagine such persons to be their natural rulers, as are at that time depriv’d of all power and authority, and whom no man, however foolish, wou’d voluntarily chuse; and this merely because they are in that line, which rul’d before, and in that degree of it, which us’d to succeed; tho’ perhaps in so distant a period, that scarce any man alive cou’d ever have given any promise of obedience. Has a government, then, no authority over such as these, because they never consented to it, and wou’d esteem the very attempt of such a free choice a piece of arrogance and impiety? We find by experience, that it punishes them very freely for what it calls treason and rebellion, which, it seems, according to this system, reduces itself to common injustice. If you say, that by dwelling in its dominions, they in effect consented to <OPB num="157"/>the establish’d government; I answer, that this can only be, where they think the affair depends on their choice, which few or none, beside those philosophers, have ever yet imagin’d. It never was pleaded as an excuse for a rebel, that the first act he perform’d, after he came to years of discretion, was to levy war against the sovereign of the state; and that while he was a child he cou’d not bind himself by his own consent, and having become a man, show’d plainly, by the first act he perform’d, that he had no design to impose on himself any obligation to obedience. We find, on the contrary, that civil laws punish this crime at the same age as any other, which is criminal, of itself, without our consent; that is, when the person is come to the full use of reason: <MPB ed="SBN" num="549"/>Whereas to this crime <del>it</del><ins comment="originally 'it'; ERRATA and manuscript alteration">they</ins> ought in justice to allow some intermediate time, in which a tacit consent at least might be suppos’d. To which we may add, that a man living under an absolute government, wou’d owe it no allegiance; since, by its very nature, it depends not on consent. But as that is as <em>natural</em> and <em>common</em> a government as any, it must certainly occasion some obligation; and ’tis plain from experience, that men, who are subjected to it, do always think <OPB num="158"/>so. This is a clear proof, that we do not commonly esteem our allegiance to be deriv’d from our consent or promise; and a farther proof is, that when our promise is upon any account expressly engag’d, we always distinguish exactly betwixt the two obligations, and believe the one to add more force to the other, than in a repetition of the same promise. Where no promise is given, a man looks not on his faith as broken in private matters, upon account of rebellion; but keeps those two duties of honour and allegiance perfectly distinct and separate. As the uniting of them was thought by these philosophers a very <del>subtle</del><ins comment="originally 'subtle'; ERRATA change">subtile</ins> invention, this is a convincing proof, that ’tis not a true one; since no man can either give a promise, or be restrain’d by its sanction and obligation unknown to himself.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="T 3.2.9.1"><para><ac><dc>T</dc>hose</ac> political writers, who have had recourse to a promise, or original contract, as the source of our allegiance to government, intended to establish a principle, which is perfectly just and reasonable; <OPB num="159"/>tho’ the reasoning, upon which they endeavour’d to establish it, was fallacious and sophistical. They wou’d prove, that our submission to government admits of exceptions, and that an egregious tyranny in the rulers is sufficient to free the subjects from all ties of allegiance. Since men enter into society, say they, and submit themselves to government, by their free and voluntary <MPB ed="SBN" num="550"/>consent, they must have in view certain advantages, which they propose to reap from it, and for which they are contented to resign their native liberty. There is, therefore, something mutual engag’d on the part of the magistrate, <em>viz.</em> protection and security; and ’tis only by the hopes he affords of these advantages, that he can ever persuade men to submit to him. But when instead of protection and security, they meet with tyranny and oppression, they are free’d from their promises, (as happens in all conditional contracts) and return to that state of liberty, which preceded the institution of government. Men wou’d never be so foolish as to enter into such engagements as shou’d turn entirely to the advantage of others, without any view of bettering their own condition. Whoever proposes to draw any profit from our submission, must engage himself, either <OPB num="160"/>expressly or tacitly, to make us reap some advantage from his authority; nor ought he to expect, that without the performance of his part we will ever continue in obedience.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.9.2"><para><sc>I repeat</sc> it: This conclusion is just, tho’ the principles be erroneous; and I flatter myself, that I can establish the same conclusion on more reasonable principles. I shall not take such a compass, in establishing our political duties, as to assert, that men perceive the advantages of government; that they institute government with a view to those advantages; that this institution requires a promise of obedience; which imposes a moral obligation to a certain degree, but being conditional, ceases to be binding, whenever the other contracting party performs not his part of the engagement. I perceive, that a promise itself arises entirely from human conventions, and is invented with a view to a certain interest. I seek, therefore, some such interest more immediately connected with government, and which may be at once the original motive to its institution, and the source of our obedience to it. This interest I find to consist in the security and protection, which we enjoy in political society, and which we can never attain, when perfectly free and <MPB ed="SBN" num="551"/>independent. <OPB num="161"/>As <del>the interest</del><ins comment="originally 'the interest'; ERRATA and manuscript deletion">interest</ins>, therefore, is the immediate sanction of government, the one can have no longer being than the other; and whenever the civil magistrate carries his oppression so far as to render his authority perfectly intolerable, we are no longer bound to submit to it. The cause ceases; the effect must cease also.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.9.3"><para><sc>So</sc> far the conclusion is immediate and direct, concerning the <em>natural</em> obligation which we have to allegiance. As to the <em>moral</em> obligation, we may observe, that the maxim wou’d here be false, that <em>when the cause ceases, the effect must cease also</em>. For there is a principle of human nature, which we have frequently taken notice of, that men are mightily addicted to <em>general rules</em>, and that we often carry our maxims beyond those reasons, which first induc’d us to establish them. Where cases are similar in many circumstances, we are apt to put them on the same footing, without considering, that they differ in the most material circumstances, and that the resemblance is more apparent than real. It may, therefore, be thought, that in the case of allegiance our moral obligation of duty will not cease, even tho’ the natural obligation of interest, which is its cause, has ceas’d; and <OPB num="162"/>that men may be bound by <em>conscience</em> to submit to a tyrannical government against their own and the public interest. And indeed, to the force of this argument I so far submit, as to acknowledge, that general rules commonly extend beyond the principles, on which they are founded; and that we seldom make any exception to them, unless that exception have the qualities of a general rule, and be founded on very numerous and common instances. Now this I assert to be entirely the present case. When men submit to the authority of others, ’tis to procure themselves some security against the wickedness and injustice of men, who are perpetually carried, by their unruly passions, and by their present and immediate interest, to the violation of all the laws of society. But as this imperfection is inherent in human nature, we know that it must attend men in all their states and conditions; and <MPB ed="SBN" num="552"/>that those, whom we chuse for rulers, do not immediately become of a superior nature to the rest of mankind, upon account of their superior power and authority. What we expect from them depends not on a change of their nature but of their situation, when they acquire a more immediate interest in the preservation of order and the <OPB num="163"/>execution of justice. But besides that this interest is only more immediate in the execution of justice among their subjects<ins comment="manuscript addition"> not in disputes betwixt themselves and subjects</ins>; besides this, I say, we may often expect, from the irregularity of human nature, that they will neglect even this immediate interest, and be transported by their passions into all the excesses of cruelty and ambition. Our general knowledge of human nature, our observation of the past history of mankind, our experience of present times; all these causes must induce us to open the door to exceptions, and must make us conclude, that we may resist the more violent effects of supreme power, without any crime or injustice.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.9.4"><para><sc>Accordingly</sc> we may observe, that this is both the general practice and principle of mankind, and that no nation, that cou’d find any remedy, ever yet suffer’d the cruel ravages of a tyrant, or were blam’d for their resistance. Those who took up arms against <em>Dionysius</em> or <em>Nero</em>, or <em>Philip the second</em>, have the favour of every reader in the perusal of their history; and nothing but the most violent perversion of common sense can ever lead us to condemn them. ’Tis certain, therefore, that in all our notions of morals we never entertain such an absurdity as that <OPB num="164"/>of passive obedience, but make allowances for resistance in the more flagrant instances of tyranny and oppression. The general opinion of mankind has some authority in all cases; but in this of morals ’tis perfectly infallible. Nor is it less infallible, because men cannot distinctly explain the principles, on which it is founded. Few persons can carry on this train of reasoning: “Government is a mere human invention for the interest of society. Where the tyranny of the governor removes this interest, it also removes the natural obligation to obedience. The <MPB ed="SBN" num="553"/>moral obligation is founded on the natural, and therefore must cease where <em>that</em> ceases; especially where the subject is such as makes us foresee very many occasions wherein the natural obligation may cease, and causes us to form a kind of general rule for the regulation of our conduct in such occurrences.” But tho’ this train of reasoning be too subtile for the vulgar, ’tis certain, that all men have an implicit notion of it, and are sensible, that they owe obedience to government merely on account of the public interest; and at the same time, that human nature is so subject to frailties and passions, as may easily pervert this institution, and change <OPB num="165"/>their governors into tyrants and public enemies. If the sense of <del>public interest</del><ins comment="originally 'public interest'; manuscript deletion (N.B. ERRATA changes this to 'common interest')">interest</ins> were not our original motive to obedience, I wou’d fain ask, what other principle is there in human nature capable of subduing the natural ambition of men, and forcing them to such a submission? Imitation and custom are not sufficient. For the question still recurs, what motive first produces those instances of submission, which we imitate, and that train of actions, which produces the custom? There evidently is no other principle than <del>public interest</del><ins comment="originally 'public interest'; manuscript deletion (N.B. ERRATA changes this to 'common interest')">interest</ins>; and if interest first produces obedience to government, the obligation to obedience must cease whenever the interest ceases, in any great degree, and in a considerable number of instances.</para></dhot>

As numerous and civiliz’d societies cannot subsist <MPB ed="SBN" num="554"/>without government, so government is entirely useless without an exact obedience. We ought always to weigh the advantages, which we reap from authority, against the disadvantages; and by this means we shall become more scrupulous of putting in practice the doctrine of resistance. The common rule requires submission; and ’tis only in cases of grievous tyranny and oppression, that the exception can take place.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.10.2"><para><sc>Since</sc> then such a blind submission is commonly due to magistracy, the next question is, <em>to whom it is due, and whom we are to regard as our lawful magistrates?</em> In order to answer this question, let us recollect what we have already establish’d concerning the origin of government and political society. When men have once experienc’d the impossibility of preserving any steady order in society, while every one is his own master, and violates or observes the laws of <del>interest</del><ins comment="originally 'interest'; ERRATA and manuscript alteration">society</ins>, according to his present interest or pleasure, they naturally run into the invention of government, and put it out of their <OPB num="167"/>own power, as far as possible, to transgress the <del>laws of society</del><ins comment="originally 'laws of society'; manuscript alteration">rules of society</ins>. Government, therefore, arises from the voluntary convention of men; and ’tis evident, that the same convention, which establishes government, will also determine the persons who are to govern, and will remove all doubt and ambiguity in this particular. And the voluntary consent of men must here have the greater efficacy, that the authority of the magistrate does <em>at first</em> stand upon the foundation of a promise of the subjects, by which they bind themselves to obedience; as in every other contract or engagement. The same promise, then, which binds them to obedience, ties them down to a particular person, and makes him the object of their allegiance.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.10.3"><para><sc>But</sc> when government has been establish’d on this footing for some considerable time, and the separate interest, which we have in submission, has produc’d a separate sentiment of morality, the case is entirely alter’d, and a promise is no longer able to determine the particular magistrate; since it <MPB ed="SBN" num="555"/>is no longer consider’d as the foundation of government. We naturally suppose ourselves born to submission; and imagine, that such particular persons have a right to command, <OPB num="168"/>as we on our part are bound to obey. These notions of right and obligation are deriv’d from nothing but the <em>advantage</em> <del>we reap</del><ins comment="originally 'we reap'; manuscript alteration">reapt</ins> from government, which gives us a repugnance to practise resistance ourselves, and makes us displeas’d with any instance of it in others. But here ’tis remarkable, that in this new state of affairs, the original sanction of government, which is <em>interest</em>, is not admitted to determine the persons, whom we are to obey, as the original sanction did at first, when affairs were on the footing of a <em>promise</em>. A <em>promise</em> fixes and determines the persons, without any uncertainty: But ’tis evident, that if men were to regulate their conduct in this particular, by the view of a peculiar <em>interest</em>, either public or private, they wou’d involve themselves in endless confusion, and wou’d render all government, in a great measure, ineffectual. The private interest of every one is different; and tho’ the public interest in itself be always one and the same, yet it becomes the source of as great dissentions, by reason of the different opinions of particular persons concerning it. The same interest, therefore, which causes us to submit to magistracy, makes us renounce itself in the choice of our magistrates, and binds us <OPB num="169"/>down to a certain form of government, and to particular persons, without allowing us to aspire to the utmost perfection in either. The case is here the same as in that law of nature concerning the stability of possession. ’Tis highly advantageous, and even absolutely necessary to society, that possession shou’d be stable; and this leads us to the establishment of such a rule: But we find, that were we to follow the same advantage, in assigning particular possessions to particular persons, we shou’d disappoint our end, and perpetuate the confusion, which that rule is intended to prevent. We must, therefore, proceed by general rules, and regulate ourselves by general interests, in modifying the law of nature concerning the <MPB ed="SBN" num="556"/>stability of possession. Nor need we fear, that our attachment to this law will diminish upon account of the seeming frivolousness of those interests, by which it is determin’d. The impulse of the mind is deriv’d from a very strong interest; and those other more minute interests serve only to direct the motion, without adding any thing to it, or diminishing from it. ’Tis the same case with government. Nothing is more advantageous to society than such an invention; and this interest is sufficient to make us em<OPB num="170"/>brace it with ardour and alacrity; tho’ we are oblig’d afterwards to regulate and direct our devotion to government by several considerations, which are not of the same importance, and to chuse our magistrates without having in view any particular advantage from the choice.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.10.4"><para><sc>The</sc> <em>first</em> of those principles I shall take notice of, as a foundation of the right of magistracy, is that which gives authority to <del>all the most establish’d governments of the world without exception</del><ins comment="originally 'all the most establish’d governments of the world without exception'; manuscript alteration">almost all the establish’d governments of the world</ins>: I mean, <em>long possession</em> in any one form of government, or succession of princes. ’Tis certain, that if we remount to the first origin of every nation, we shall find, that there scarce is any race of kings, or form of a commonwealth, that is not primarily founded on usurpation and rebellion, and whose title is not at first worse than doubtful and uncertain. Time alone gives solidity to their right; and operating gradually on the minds of men, reconciles them to any authority, and makes it seem just and reasonable. Nothing causes any sentiment to have a greater influence upon us than custom, or turns our imagination more strongly to any object. When we have been long accustom’d to obey any set of men, that general instinct or tendency, <OPB num="171"/>which we have to suppose a moral obligation attending loyalty, takes easily this direction, and chuses that set of men for its objects. ’Tis interest which gives the general instinct; but ’tis custom which gives the particular direction.</para></dhot>

We naturally judge of every thing by comparison; and since in considering the fate of kingdoms and republics, we embrace a long extent of time, a small duration has not in this case a like influence on our sentiments, as when we consider any other object. One thinks he acquires a right to a horse, or a suit of cloaths, in a very short time; but a century is scarce sufficient to establish any new government, or remove all scruples in the minds of the subjects concerning it. Add to this, that a shorter period of time will suffice to give a prince a title to any additional power he may usurp, than will serve to fix his right, where the whole is an usurpation. The kings of <em>France</em> have not been possess’d of absolute power for above two reigns; and yet nothing will appear more extravagant to <em>Frenchmen</em> than to talk <OPB num="172"/>of their liberties.

If the same principles did not take place with regard to the property of private persons, ’twas because these principles were counter-ballanc’d by very strong considerations of interest; when we observ’d, that all restitution wou’d by that means be prevented, and every violence be authoriz’d and protected. And tho’ the same motives may seem to have force, with regard to public authority, yet they are oppos’d by a contrary interest; which consists in the preservation of peace, and the avoiding of all changes, which, however they may be easily produc’d in private affairs, are unavoidably attended with blood<OPB num="173"/>shed and confusion, where the public is interested.</para></dhot>

No maxim is more conformable, both to prudence and morals, than to submit quietly to the government, which we find establish’d in the country where we happen to live, without enquiring too curiously into its origin and first establishment. Few governments will bear being examin’d so rigorously. How many kingdoms are there at present in the world, and how many more do we find in history, whose governors have no better foundation for their authority than that of present possession? To confine ourselves to the <em>Roman</em> and <em>Grecian</em> empire; is it not evident, that the long succession of emperors, from the dissolution of the <em>Roman</em> liberty, to the final extinction of that empire by the <em>Turks</em>, cou’d not so much as pretend to any other title to the empire? The election of the senate was a mere form, which always <OPB num="174"/>follow’d the choice of the legions; and these were almost always divided in the different provinces, and nothing but the sword was able to terminate the difference. ’Twas by the sword, therefore, that every emperor acquir’d, as well as defended his right; and we must either say, that all the known world, for so many ages, had no government, and ow’d no allegiance to any one, or must allow, that the right of the stronger, in public affairs, is to be receiv’d as legitimate, and authoriz’d by morality, when not oppos’d by any other title.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="T 3.2.10.10"><para><sc>These</sc> reasons have some weight; but I am persuaded, that to one, who considers impartially of the matter, ’twill appear, that <del>there concur some principles of the imagination, along</del><ins comment="originally 'there concur some principles of the imagination, along'; manuscript alteration">some principles of the imagination concur</ins> with those views of <ins comment="manuscript addition">justice and</ins> interest.

<dhot id="T 3.2.10.11"><para><sc>To</sc> confirm this we may weigh the following ph<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>nomena, which are pretty curious in their kind. In elective monarchies the right of succession has no place by the laws and settled custom; and yet its influence is so natural, that ’tis impossible <MPB ed="SBN" num="560"/>entirely to exclude it from the imagination, and render the subjects indifferent to the son of their deceas’d monarch. Hence in some governments of this kind, the choice commonly falls on one or other of the royal family; and in some governments they are all excluded. Those contrary ph<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>nomena proceed from the same principle. Where the royal family is excluded, ’tis from a refinement in politics, which makes people sensible of their propensity to chuse a sovereign in that family, and gives them a jealousy of their liberty, lest their new monarch, aided by this propensity, shou’d establish his family, and destroy the freedom of elections for the future.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.10.12"><para><sc>The</sc> history of <em>Artaxerxes</em>, and the younger <em>Cyrus</em>, may furnish us with some reflections to the same purpose. <em>Cyrus</em> pretended a right to the throne above his elder brother, because he was born after his father’s accession.

I wou’d only infer from it, that he wou’d never have made use of such a pretext, were it not for the qualities of the imagination above-mention’d, by which we are naturally inclin’d to unite by a new relation whatever objects we find already united. <em>Artaxerxes</em> had an advantage above his brother, as being the eldest son, and the first in succession: But <em>Cyrus</em> was more closely related to the royal authority, as being begot after his father was invested with it.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.10.13"><para><sc>Shou</sc>’<sc>d</sc> it here be pretended, that the view of convenience may be the source of all the right of succession, and that men gladly take advantage of any rule, by which they can fix the successor of their late sovereign, and prevent that anarchy and confusion, which attends all new elections: To this I wou’d answer, <del>that I readily allow, that this motive may contribute something</del><ins comment="originally 'that I readily allow, that this motive may contribute something'; manuscript alteration">that perhaps this motive may contribute somewhat</ins> to the effect; <del>but at the same time I assert, that</del><ins comment="originally 'but at the same time I assert, that'; manuscript deletion">but that</ins> without another principle, ’tis impossible <OPB num="178"/>such a motive shou’d take place. The interest of a nation requires, that the succession to the crown shou’d be fix’d one way or other; but ’tis the same thing to its interest in what way it be fix’d: So that if the relation of blood had not <MPB ed="SBN" num="561"/>an effect independent of public interest, it wou’d never have been regarded, without a positive law; and ’twou’d have been impossible, that so many positive laws of different nations cou’d ever have concur’d precisely in the same views and intentions.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.10.14"><para><sc>This</sc> leads us to consider the <em>fifth</em> source of authority, viz. <em>positive laws</em>; when the legislature establishes a certain form of government and succession of princes. At first sight it may be thought, that this must resolve into some of the preceding titles of authority. The legislative power, whence the positive law is deriv’d, must either be establish’d by original contract, long possession, present possession, conquest, or succession; and consequently the positive law must derive its force from some of those principles. But here ’tis remarkable, that tho’ a positive law can only derive its force from these principles, yet it acquires not all the force of the principle from whence it is deriv’d, but loses considerably in the transi<OPB num="179"/>tion; as it is natural to imagine. For instance; a government is establish’d for many centuries on a certain system of laws, forms, and methods of succession. The legislative power, establish’d by this long succession, changes all on a sudden the whole system of government, and introduces a new constitution in its stead. I believe few of the subjects will think themselves bound to comply with this alteration, unless it have an evident tendency to the public good: But will think themselves still at liberty to return to the antient government. Hence the notion of <em>fundamental laws</em>; which are suppos’d to be inalterable by the will of the sovereign: And of this nature the <em>Salic</em> law is understood to be in <em>France</em>. How far these fundamental laws extend is not determin’d in any government; nor is it possible it ever shou’d. There is such an insensible gradation from the most material laws to the most trivial, and from the most antient laws to the most modern, that ’twill be impossible to set bounds to the legislative power, and determine how far it may innovate in the principles of government. <MPB ed="SBN" num="562"/>That is the work more of imagination and passion than of reason.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.10.15"><para><sc>Whoever</sc> considers the history of the several nations of the world; their revolutions, conquests, increase, and diminution; the manner in which their particular governments are establish’d, and the successive right transmitted from one person to another, will soon learn to treat very lightly all disputes concerning the rights of princes, and will be convinc’d, that a strict adherence to any general rules, and the rigid loyalty to particular persons and families, on which some people set so high a value, are virtues that hold less of reason, than of bigotry and superstition. In this particular, the study of history confirms the reasonings of true philosophy; which, shewing us the original qualities of human nature, teaches us to regard the controversies in politics as incapable of any decision in most cases, and as entirely subordinate to the interests of peace and liberty. Where the public good does not evidently demand a change; ’tis certain, that the concurrence of all those titles, <em>original contract</em>, <em>long possession</em>, <em>present possession</em>, <em>succession</em>, and <em>positive laws</em>, forms the strongest title to sovereignty, and is justly regarded as sacred and inviolable. But when these titles are mingled and oppos’d in different degrees, <OPB num="181"/>they often occasion perplexity; and are less capable of solution from the arguments of lawyers and philosophers, than from the swords of the soldiery. Who shall tell me, for instance, whether <em>Germanicus</em>, or <em>Drusus</em>, ought to have succeeded <em>Tiberius</em>, had he died while they were both alive, without naming any of them for his successor? Ought the right of adoption to be receiv’d as equivalent to that of blood in a nation, where it had the same effect in private families, and had already, in two instances, taken place in the public? Ought <em>Germanicus</em> to be esteem’d the eldest son, because he was born before <em>Drusus</em>; or the younger, because he was adopted after the birth of his brother? Ought the right of the elder to be regarded in a nation, where the eldest brother had no advantage in the <MPB ed="SBN" num="563"/>succession to private families? Ought the <em>Roman</em> empire at that time to be esteem’d hereditary, because of two examples; or ought it, even so early, to be regarded as belonging to the stronger, or the present possessor, as being founded on so recent an usurpation? Upon whatever principles we may pretend to answer these and such like questions, I am afraid we shall never be able to satisfy an impartial enquirer, who adopts no party in political controver<OPB num="182"/>sies, and will be satisfied with nothing but sound reason and philosophy.<br/></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.10.16"><para><sc>But</sc> here an <em>English</em> reader will be apt to enquire concerning that famous <em>revolution</em>, which has had such a happy influence on our constitution, and has been attended with such mighty consequences. We have already remark’d, that in the case of enormous tyranny and oppression, ’tis lawful to take arms even against supreme power; and that as government is a mere human invention for mutual advantage and security, it no longer imposes any obligation, either natural or moral, when once it ceases to have that tendency. But tho’ this <em>general</em> principle be authoriz’d by common sense, and the practice of all ages, ’tis certainly impossible for the laws, or even for philosophy, to establish any <em>particular</em> rules, by which we may know when resistance is lawful; and decide all controversies, which may arise on that subject. This may not only happen with regard to supreme power; but ’tis possible, even in some constitutions, where the legislative authority is not lodg’d in one person, that there may be a magistrate so eminent and powerful, as to oblige the laws to keep silence in this par<OPB num="183"/>ticular. Nor wou’d this silence be an effect only of their <em>respect</em>, but also of their <em>prudence</em>; since ’tis certain, that in the vast variety of circumstances, which occur in all governments, <del>an exercise</del><ins comment="originally 'an exercise'; manuscript alteration">a particular exercise</ins> of power, in so great a magistrate, may at one time be beneficial to the public, which at another time wou’d be pernicious and tyrannical. But notwithstanding this silence of the laws in limited monarchies, ’tis certain, that the people still retain the <MPB ed="SBN" num="564"/>right of resistance; since ’tis impossible, even in the most despotic governments, to deprive them of it. The same necessity of self-preservation, and the same motive of public good, give them the same liberty in the one case as in the other. And we may farther observe, that in such mix’d governments, the cases, wherein resistance is lawful, must occur much oftener, and greater indulgence be given to the subjects to defend themselves by force of arms, than in arbitrary governments. Not only where the chief magistrate enters into measures, in themselves, extremely pernicious to the public, but even when he wou’d encroach on the other parts of the constitution, and extend his power beyond the legal bounds, it is allowable to resist and dethrone him; tho’ such resistance <OPB num="184"/>and violence may, in the general tenor of the laws, be deem’d unlawful and rebellious. For besides that nothing is more essential to public interest, than the preservation of public liberty; ’tis evident, that if such a mix’d government be once suppos’d to be establish’d, every part or member of the constitution must have a right of self-defence, and of maintaining its antient bounds against the encroachment of every other authority. As matter wou’d have been created in vain, were it depriv’d of a power of resistance, without which no part of it cou’d preserve a distinct existence, and the whole might be crowded up into a single point: So ’tis a gross absurdity to suppose, in any government, a right without a remedy, or allow, that the supreme power is shar’d with the people, without allowing, that ’tis lawful for them to defend their share against every invader. Those, therefore, who wou’d seem to respect our free government, and yet deny the right of resistance, have renounc’d all pretensions to common sense, and do not merit a serious answer.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.10.17"><para><sc>It</sc> does not belong to my present purpose to shew, that these general principles are applicable to the late <em>revolution</em>; and that all the rights and privileges, which ought <OPB num="185"/>to be sacred to a free nation, were at that time threaten’d with the utmost danger. I am better pleas’d to leave this controverted <MPB ed="SBN" num="565"/>subject, if it really admits of controversy; and to indulge myself in some philosophical reflections, which naturally arise from that important event.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.10.18"><para><em>First</em>, We may observe, that shou’d the <em>lords</em> and <em>commons</em> in our constitution, without any reason from public interest, either depose the king in being, or after his death exclude the prince, who, by laws and settled custom, ought to succeed, no one wou’d esteem their proceedings legal, or think themselves bound to comply with them. But shou’d the king, by his unjust practices, or his attempts for a tyrannical and despotic power, justly forfeit his legal, it then not only becomes morally lawful and suitable to the nature of political society to dethrone him; but what is more, we are apt likewise to think, that the remaining members of the constitution acquire a right of excluding his next heir, and of chusing whom they please for his successor. This is founded on a very singular quality of our thought and imagination. When a king forfeits his authority, his heir ought naturally to remain in the same situation, as if the king were remov’d <OPB num="186"/>by death; unless by mixing himself in the tyranny, he forfeit it for himself. But tho’ this may seem reasonable, we easily comply with the contrary opinion. The deposition of a king, in such a government as ours, is certainly an act beyond all common authority, and an illegal assuming a power for public good, which, in the ordinary course of government, can belong to no member of the constitution. When the public good is so great and so evident as to justify the action, the commendable use of this licence causes us naturally to attribute to the <em>parliament</em> a right of using farther licences; and the antient bounds of the laws being once transgressed with approbation, we are not apt to be so strict in confining ourselves precisely within their limits. The mind naturally runs on with any train of action, which it has begun; nor do we commonly make any scruple concerning our duty, after the first action of any kind, which we perform. Thus at the <em>revolution</em>, <del>no one</del><ins comment="originally 'no one'; manuscript alteration">none</ins> who thought the deposition of <MPB ed="SBN" num="566"/>the father justifiable, esteem’d themselves to be confin’d to his infant son; tho’ had that unhappy monarch died innocent at that time, and had his son, by any accident, been convey’d beyond seas, there is no doubt but a regency wou’d have <OPB num="187"/>been appointed till he shou’d come to age, and cou’d be restor’d to his dominions. As the slightest properties of the imagination have an effect on the judgments of the people, it shews the wisdom of the laws and of the parliament to take advantage of such properties, and to chuse the magistrates either in or out of a line, according as the vulgar will most naturally attribute authority and right to them.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.10.19"><para><em>Secondly</em>, Tho’ the accession of the <em>Prince</em> of <em>Orange</em> to the throne might at first give occasion to many disputes, and his title be contested, it ought not now to appear doubtful, but must have acquir’d a sufficient authority from those three princes, who have succeeded him upon the same title. Nothing is more usual, tho’ nothing may, at first sight, appear more unreasonable, than this way of thinking. Princes often <em>seem</em> to acquire a right from their successors, as well as from their ancestors; and a king, who during his life-time might justly be deem’d an usurper, will be regarded by posterity as a lawful prince, because he has had the good fortune to settle his family on the throne, and entirely change the antient form of government. <em>Julius C<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>sar</em> is regarded as the first <em>Roman</em> emperor; while <em>Sylla</em> and <OPB num="188"/><em>Marius</em>, whose titles were really the same as his, are treated as tyrants and usurpers. Time and custom give authority to all forms of government, and all successions of princes; and that power, which at first was founded only on injustice and violence, becomes in time legal and obligatory. Nor does the mind rest there; but returning back upon its footsteps, transfers to their predecessors and ancestors that right, which it naturally ascribes to the posterity, as being related together, and united in the imagination. The present <em>king</em> of <em>France</em> makes <em>Hugh Capet</em> a more lawful prince than <em>Cromwell</em>; as the establish’d <MPB ed="SBN" num="567"/>liberty of the <em>Dutch</em> is no inconsiderable apology for their obstinate resistance to <em>Philip</em> the second.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="T 3.2.11.1"><para><ac><dc>W</dc>hen</ac> civil government has been establish’d over the greatest part of mankind, and different societies have been form’d contiguous to each other, there arises a new set of duties among the neighbouring states, suitable to the nature of that commerce, which they carry on with each <OPB num="189"/>other. Political writers tell us, that in every kind of intercourse, a body politic is to be consider’d as one person; and indeed this assertion is so far just, that different nations, as well as private persons, require mutual assistance; at the same time that their selfishness and ambition are perpetual sources of war and discord. But tho’ nations in this particular resemble individuals, yet as they are very different in other respects, no wonder they regulate themselves by different maxims, and give rise to a new set of rules, which we call <em>the laws of nations</em>. Under this head we may comprize the sacredness of the persons of ambassadors, the declaration of war, the abstaining from poison’d arms, with other duties of that kind, which are evidently calculated for the commerce, that is peculiar to different societies.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.11.2"><para><sc>But</sc> tho’ these rules be super-added to the laws of nature, the former do not entirely abolish the latter; and one may safely affirm, that the three fundamental rules of justice, the stability of possession, its transference by consent, and the performance of promises, are duties of princes, as well as of subjects. The same interest produces the same effect in both cases. Where possession has no stability, there must be perpetual <OPB num="190"/>war. Where property is not transferr’d by consent, there can be no commerce. Where promises are not observ’d, there can be no leagues nor alliances. The <MPB ed="SBN" num="568"/>advantages, therefore, of peace, commerce, and mutual succour, make us extend to different kingdoms the same notions of justice, which take place among individuals.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.11.3"><para><sc>There</sc> is a maxim very current in the world, which few politicians are willing to avow, but which has been authoriz’d by the practice of all ages, <em>that there is a system of morals calculated for princes, much more free than that which ought to govern private persons</em>. ’Tis evident this is not to be understood of the lesser <em>extent</em> of public duties and obligations; nor will any one be so extravagant as to assert, that the most solemn treaties ought to have no force among princes. For as princes do actually form treaties among themselves, they must propose some advantage from the execution of them; and the prospect of such advantage for the future must engage them to perform their part, and must establish that law of nature. The meaning, therefore, of this political maxim is, that tho’ the morality of princes has the same <em>extent</em>, yet it has not the same <em>force</em> as that of private persons, <OPB num="191"/>and may lawfully be transgress’d from a more trivial motive. However shocking such a proposition may appear to certain philosophers, ’twill be easy to defend it upon those principles, by which we have accounted for the origin of justice and equity.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.11.4"><para><sc>When</sc> men have found by experience, that ’tis impossible to subsist without society, and that ’tis impossible to maintain society, while they give free course to their appetites; so urgent an interest quickly restrains their actions, and imposes an obligation to observe those rules, which we call <em>the laws of justice</em>. This obligation of interest rests not here; but by the necessary course of the passions and sentiments, gives rise to the moral obligation of duty; while we approve of such actions as tend to the peace of society, and disapprove of such as tend to its disturbance. The same <em>natural</em> obligation of interest takes place among independent kingdoms, and gives rise to the same <em>morality</em>; so that no one of ever so corrupt morals will approve of a prince, who volun<MPB ed="SBN" num="569"/>tarily, and of his own accord, breaks his word, or violates any treaty. But here we may observe, that tho’ the intercourse of different states be advantageous, and even sometimes necessary, yet it is not so necessary nor advantageous as <OPB num="192"/>that among individuals, without which ’tis utterly impossible for human nature ever to subsist. Since, therefore, the <em>natural</em> obligation to justice, among different states, is not so strong as among individuals, the <em>moral</em> obligation, which arises from it, must partake of its weakness; and we must necessarily give a greater indulgence to a prince or minister, who deceives another; than to a private gentleman, who breaks his word of honour.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.11.5"><para><sc>Shou</sc>’<sc>d</sc> it be ask’d, <em>what proportion these two species of morality bear to each other?</em> I wou’d answer, that this is a question, to which we can never give any precise answer; nor is it possible to reduce to numbers the proportion, which we ought to fix betwixt them. One may safely affirm, that this proportion finds itself, without any art or study of men; as we may observe on many other occasions. The practice of the world goes farther in teaching us the degrees of our duty, than the most subtile philosophy, which was ever yet invented. And this may serve as a convincing proof, that all men have an implicit notion of the foundation of those moral rules concerning natural and civil justice, and are sensible, that they arise merely from human conventions, and from the in<OPB num="193"/>terest, which we have in the preservation of peace and order. For otherwise the diminution of the interest wou’d never produce a relaxation of the morality, and reconcile us more easily to any transgression of justice among princes and republics, than in the private commerce of one subject with another.</para></dhot>

To remove, as far as possible, all scruples of this kind, I shall here consider another set of duties, <em>viz.</em> the <em>modesty</em> and <em>chastity</em> which belong to the fair sex: And I doubt not but these virtues will be found to be still more conspicuous instances of the operation of those principles, which I have insisted on.</para></dhot>

I believe I may spare myself the trouble of insisting on so obvious a subject, and may proceed, without farther preparation, to examine after what manner such notions arise from education, from the voluntary conventions of men, and from the interest of society.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.12.3"><para><sc>Whoever</sc> considers the length and feebleness of human infancy, with the concern which both sexes naturally have for their offspring, will easily perceive, that there must be an union of male and female for the education of the young, and that this union must be of considerable duration. But in order to induce the men to impose on themselves this restraint, and undergo chearfully all the fatigues and expences, to which it subjects them, they must believe, that the children are their own, and that their natural instinct is not directed to a wrong object, when they give a loose to love and tenderness. Now if we examine <OPB num="195"/>the structure of the human body, we shall find, that this security is very difficult to be attain’d <MPB ed="SBN" num="571"/>on our part; and that since, in the copulation of the sexes, the principle of generation goes from the man to the woman, an error may easily take place on the side of the former, tho’ it be utterly impossible with regard to the latter. From this trivial and anatomical observation is deriv’d that vast difference betwixt the education and duties of the two sexes.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.12.4"><para><sc>Were</sc> a philosopher to examine the matter <em>a priori</em>, he wou’d reason after the following manner. Men are induc’d to labour for the maintenance and education of their children, by the persuasion that they are really their own; and therefore ’tis reasonable, and even necessary, to give them some security in this particular. This security cannot consist entirely in the imposing of severe punishments on any transgressions of conjugal fidelity on the part of the wife; since these public punishments cannot be inflicted without legal proof, which ’tis difficult to meet with in this subject. What restraint, therefore, shall we impose on women, in order to counter-balance so strong a temptation as they have to <del>fidelity</del><ins comment="originally 'fidelity'; ERRATA and manuscript alteration">infidelity</ins>? There seems to be no restraint possible, but in the <OPB num="196"/>punishment of bad fame or reputation; a punishment, which has a mighty influence on the human mind, and at the same time is inflicted by the world upon surmizes, and conjectures, and proofs, that wou’d never be receiv’d in any court of judicature. In order, therefore, to impose a due restraint on the female sex, we must attach a peculiar degree of shame to their infidelity, above what arises merely from its injustice, and must bestow proportionable praises on their chastity.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.12.5"><para><sc>But</sc> tho’ this be a very strong motive to fidelity, our philosopher wou’d quickly discover, that it wou’d not alone be sufficient to that purpose. All human creatures, especially of the female sex, are apt to over-look remote motives in favour of any present temptation: The temptation is here the strongest imaginable: Its approaches are insensible and seducing: And a woman easily finds, or flatters herself she shall find, certain means of securing her reputation, and pre<MPB ed="SBN" num="572"/>venting all the pernicious consequences of her pleasures. ’Tis necessary, therefore, that, beside the infamy attending such licences, there shou’d be some preceding backwardness or dread, which may prevent their first approaches, and may give the female sex a <OPB num="197"/>repugnance to all expressions, and postures, and liberties, that have an immediate relation to that enjoyment.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.12.6"><para><sc>Such</sc> wou’d be the reasonings of our speculative philosopher: But I am persuaded, that if he had not a perfect knowledge of human nature, he wou’d be apt to regard them as mere chimerical speculations, and wou’d consider the infamy attending infidelity, and backwardness to all its approaches, as principles that were rather to be wish’d than hop’d for in the world. For what means, wou’d he say, of persuading mankind, that the transgressions of conjugal duty are more infamous than any other kind of injustice, when ’tis evident they are more excusable, upon account of the greatness of the temptation? And what possibility of giving a backwardness to the approaches of a pleasure, to which nature has inspir’d so strong a propensity; and a propensity that ’tis absolutely necessary in the end to comply with, for the support of the species?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.2.12.7"><para><sc>But</sc> speculative reasonings, which cost so much pains to philosophers, are often form’d by the world naturally, and without reflection: As difficulties, which seem unsurmountable in theory, are easily got over in practice. Those, who have an interest <OPB num="198"/>in the fidelity of women, naturally disapprove of their infidelity, and all the approaches to it. Those, who have no interest, are carried along with the stream<ins comment="manuscript addition">, and are also apt to be affected with sympathy for the general interests of society</ins>. Education takes possession of the ductile minds of the fair sex in their infancy. And when a general rule of this kind is once establish’d, men are apt to extend it beyond those principles, from which it first arose. Thus batchelors, however debauch’d, cannot chuse but be shock’d with any instance of lewdness or impudence in women. And tho’ all these maxims have a plain reference to generation, yet women past <MPB ed="SBN" num="573"/>child-bearing have no more privilege in this respect, than those who are in the flower of their youth and beauty. Men have undoubtedly an implicit notion, that all those ideas of modesty and decency have a regard to generation; since they impose not the same laws, <em>with the same force</em>, on the male sex, where that reason takes not place. The exception is there obvious and extensive, and founded on a remarkable difference, which produces a clear separation and disjunction of ideas. But as the case is not the same with regard to the different ages of women, for this reason, tho’ men know, that these notions are founded on the public interest, yet the <OPB num="199"/>general rule carries us beyond the original principle, and makes us extend the notions of modesty over the whole sex, from their earliest infancy to their extremest old-age and infirmity.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="T 3.3.1.1"><para><ac><dc>W</dc>e</ac> come now to the examination of such virtues and vices as are entirely natural, and have no dependance on the artifice and contrivance of men. The examination of these will conclude this system of morals.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.2"><para><sc>The</sc> chief spring or actuating principle of the human mind is pleasure or pain; and when these sensations are remov’d, both from our thought and feeling, we are, in a great measure, incapable of passion or action, of desire or volition. The most immediate effects of pleasure and pain are the propense <OPB num="202"/>and averse motions of the mind; which are diversified into volition, into desire and aversion, grief and joy, hope and fear, according as the pleasure or pain changes its situation, and becomes probable or improbable, certain or uncertain, or is consider’d as out of our power for the present moment. But when along with this, the objects, that cause pleasure or pain, acquire a relation to ourselves or others; they still continue to excite desire and aversion, grief and joy: But cause, at the same time, the indirect passions of pride or humility, love or hatred, which in this case have a double relation of impressions and ideas to the pain or pleasure.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.3"><para><sc>We</sc> have already observ’d, that moral distinctions depend entirely on certain peculiar sentiments of pain and pleasure, and that whatever mental quality in ourselves or others gives <MPB ed="SBN" num="575"/>us a satisfaction, by the survey or reflection, is of course virtuous; as every thing of this nature, that gives uneasiness, is vicious. Now since every quality in ourselves or others, which gives pleasure, always causes pride or love; as every one, that produces uneasiness, excites humility or hatred: It follows, that these two particulars are to be consider’d as equivalent, with regard to our mental qualities, <em>virtue</em> and the power <OPB num="203"/>of producing love or pride, <em>vice</em> and the power of producing humility or hatred. In every case, therefore, we must judge of the one by the other; and may pronounce any <em>quality</em> of the mind virtuous, which causes love or pride; and any one vicious, which causes hatred or humility.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.4"><para><sc>If</sc> any <em>action</em> be either virtuous or vicious, ’tis only as a sign of some quality or character. It must depend upon durable principles of the mind, which extend over the whole conduct, and enter into the personal character. Actions themselves, not proceeding from any constant principle, have no influence on love or hatred, pride or humility; and consequently are never consider’d in morality.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.5"><para><sc>This</sc> reflection is self-evident, and deserves to be attended to, as being of the utmost importance in the present subject. We are never to consider any single action in our enquiries concerning the origin of morals; but only the quality or character from which the action proceeded. These alone are <em>durable</em> enough to affect our sentiments concerning the person. Actions are, indeed, better indications of a character than words, or even wishes and sentiments; but ’tis only so far as they are such indications, that they <OPB num="204"/>are attended with love or hatred, praise or blame.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.6"><para><sc>To</sc> discover the true origin of morals, and of that love or hatred, which arises from mental qualities, we must take the matter pretty deep, and compare some principles, which have been already examin’d and explain’d.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.7"><para><sc>We</sc> may begin with considering a-new the nature and force of <em>sympathy</em>. The minds of all men are similar in their feelings and operations, nor can any one be actuated <MPB ed="SBN" num="576"/>by any affection, of which all others are not, in some degree, susceptible. As in strings equally wound up, the motion of one communicates itself to the rest; so all the affections readily pass from one person to another, and beget correspondent movements in every human creature. When I see the <em>effects</em> of passion in the voice and gesture of any person, my mind immediately passes from these effects to their causes, and forms such a lively idea of the passion, as is presently converted into the passion itself. In like manner, when I perceive the <em>causes</em> of any emotion, my mind is convey’d to the effects, and is actuated with a like emotion. Were I present at any of the more terrible operations of surgery, <OPB num="205"/>’tis certain, that even before it begun, the preparation of the instruments, the laying of the bandages in order, the heating of the irons, with all the signs of anxiety and concern in the patient and assistants, wou’d have a great effect upon my mind, and excite the strongest sentiments of pity and terror. No passion of another discovers itself immediately to the mind. We are only sensible of its causes or effects. From <em>these</em> we infer the passion: And consequently <em>these</em> give rise to our sympathy.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.8"><para><sc>Our</sc> sense of beauty depends very much on this principle; and where any object has a tendency to produce pleasure in its possessor, it is always regarded as beautiful; as every object, that has a tendency to produce pain, is disagreeable and deform’d. Thus the conveniency of a house, the fertility of a field, the strength of a horse, the capacity, security, and swift-sailing of a vessel, form the principal beauty of these several objects. Here the object, which is denominated beautiful, pleases only by its tendency to produce a certain effect. That effect is the pleasure or advantage of some other person. Now the pleasure of a stranger, for whom we have no friendship, pleases us only by sympathy. To this principle, therefore, is <OPB num="206"/>owing the beauty, which we find in every thing that is useful. How considerable a part this is of beauty will easily appear upon reflection. Wherever an <MPB ed="SBN" num="577"/>object has a tendency to produce pleasure in the possessor, or in other words, is the proper <em>cause</em> of pleasure, it is sure to please the spectator, by a delicate sympathy with the possessor. Most of the works of art are esteem’d beautiful, in proportion to their fitness for the use of man, and even many of the productions of nature derive their beauty from that source. Handsome and beautiful, on most occasions, is not an absolute but a relative quality, and pleases us by nothing but its tendency to produce an end that is agreeable<footnote num="83" sym="a"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.9"><para><sc>The</sc> same principle produces, in many instances, our sentiments of morals, as well as those of beauty. No virtue is more esteem’d than justice, and no vice more detested than injustice; nor are there any qualities, which go farther to the fixing the character, either as amiable or odious. Now justice is a moral virtue, merely because it has that tendency <OPB num="207"/>to the good of mankind; and, indeed, is nothing but an artificial invention to that purpose. The same may be said of allegiance, of the laws of nations, of modesty, and of good-manners. All these are mere human contrivances for the interest of society. <ins comment="manuscript addition">The inventors of them had chiefly in view their own interest. But we carry our approbation of them into the most distant countreys and ages, and much beyond our own interest.</ins> And since there is a very strong sentiment of morals, which <del>in all nations, and all ages, has</del><ins comment="originally 'in all nations, and all ages, has'; manuscript alteration">has always</ins> attended them, we must allow, that the reflecting on the tendency of characters and mental qualities, is sufficient to give us the sentiments of approbation and blame. Now as the means to an end can only be agreeable, where the end is agreeable; and as the good of society, where our own interest is not concern’d, or that of our friends, pleases only by sympathy: It follows, that sympathy is the source of the esteem, which we pay to all the artificial virtues.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.10"><para><sc>Thus</sc> it appears, <em>that</em> sympathy is a very powerful principle in human nature, <em>that</em> it has a great influence on our taste of beauty, and <em>that</em> it produces our sentiment of morals in all <MPB ed="SBN" num="578"/>the artificial virtues. From thence we may presume, that it also gives rise to many of the other virtues; and that qualities acquire our approbation, because of their tendency to the good of mankind. This presumption must become a certainty, when we <OPB num="208"/>find that most of those qualities, which we <em>naturally</em> approve of, have actually that tendency, and render a man a proper member of society: While the qualities, which we <em>naturally</em> disapprove of, have a contrary tendency, and render any intercourse with the person dangerous or disagreeable. For having found, that such tendencies have force enough to produce the strongest sentiment of morals, we can never reasonably, in these cases, look for any other cause of approbation or blame; it being an inviolable maxim in philosophy, that where any particular cause is sufficient for an effect, we ought to rest satisfied with it, and ought not to multiply causes without necessity. We have happily attain’d experiments in the artificial virtues, where the tendency of qualities to the good of society, is the <em>sole</em> cause of our approbation, without any suspicion of the concurrence of another principle. From thence we learn the force of that principle. And where that principle may take place, and the quality approv’d of is really beneficial to society, a true philosopher will never require any other principle to account for the strongest approbation and esteem.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.11"><para><sc>That</sc> many of the natural virtues have this tendency to the good of society, no one <OPB num="209"/>can doubt of. Meekness, beneficence, charity, generosity, clemency, moderation, equity, bear the greatest figure among the moral qualities, and are commonly denominated the <em>social</em> virtues, to mark their tendency to the good of society. This goes so far, that some philosophers have represented all moral distinctions as the effect of artifice and education, when skilful politicians endeavour’d to restrain the turbulent passions of men, and make them operate to the public good, by the notions of honour and shame. This system, however, is not consistent with experience. For, <em>first</em>, there are other virtues and vices beside those which <MPB ed="SBN" num="579"/>have this tendency to the public advantage and loss. <em>Secondly</em>, had not men a natural sentiment of approbation and blame, it cou’d never be excited by politicians; nor wou’d the words <em>laudable</em> and <em>praise-worthy</em>, <em>blameable</em> and <em>odious</em>, be any more intelligible, than if they were a language perfectly unknown to us, as we have already observ’d. But tho’ this system be erroneous, it may teach us, that moral distinctions arise, in a great measure, from the tendency of qualities and characters to the <del>interests</del><ins comment="originally 'interests'; manuscript alteration">interest</ins> of society, and that ’tis our concern for that interest, which makes us approve or disapprove of them. Now we <OPB num="210"/>have no such extensive concern for society but from sympathy; and consequently ’tis that principle, which takes us so far out of ourselves, as to give us the same pleasure or uneasiness in the characters of others <ins comment="manuscript addition">which are useful or pernicious to society</ins> as if they had a tendency to our own advantage or loss.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.12"><para><sc>The</sc> only difference betwixt the natural virtues and justice lies in this, that the good, which results from the former, arises from every single act, and is the object of some natural passion: Whereas a single act of justice, consider’d in itself, may often be contrary to the public good; and ’tis only the concurrence of mankind, in a general scheme or system of action, which is advantageous. When I relieve persons in distress, my natural humanity is my motive; and so far as my succour extends, so far have I promoted the happiness of my fellow-creatures. But if we examine all the questions, that come before any tribunal of justice, we shall find, that, considering each case apart, it wou’d as often be an instance of humanity to decide contrary to the laws of justice as conformable to them. Judges take from a poor man to give to a rich; they bestow on the dissolute the labour of the industrious; and put into the hands of the vicious the means <OPB num="211"/>of harming both themselves and others. The whole scheme, however, of law and justice is advantageous to the society<ins comment="manuscript addition"> and to every individual;</ins> and ’twas with a view to this advantage, that men, by their voluntary conventions, establish’d it. After it is once establish’d by these conventions, it is <em>naturally</em> attended with a <MPB ed="SBN" num="580"/>strong sentiment of morals; which can proceed from nothing but our sympathy with the interests of society. We need no other explication of that esteem, which attends such of the natural virtues, as have a tendency to the public good.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.13"><para><sc>I must</sc> farther add, that there are several circumstances, which render this hypothesis much more probable with regard to the natural than the artificial virtues. ’Tis certain, that the imagination is more affected by what is particular, than by what is general; and that the sentiments are always mov’d with difficulty, where their objects are, in any degree, loose and undetermin’d: Now every particular act of justice is not beneficial to society, but the whole scheme or system: And it may not, perhaps, be any individual person, for whom we are concern’d, who receives benefit from justice, but the whole society alike. On the contrary, every particular act of generosity, or <OPB num="212"/>relief of the industrious and indigent, is beneficial; and is beneficial to a particular person, who is not undeserving of it. ’Tis more natural, therefore, to think, that the tendencies of the latter virtue will affect our sentiments, and command our approbation, than those of the former; and therefore, since we find, that the approbation of the former arises from their tendencies, we may ascribe, with better reason, the same cause to the approbation of the latter. In any number of similar effects, if a cause can be discover’d for one, we ought to extend that cause to all the other effects, which can be accounted for by it: But much more, if these other effects be attended with peculiar circumstances, which facilitate the operation of that cause.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.14"><para><sc>Before</sc> I proceed farther, I must observe two remarkable circumstances in this affair, which may seem objections to the present system. The first may be thus explain’d. When any quality, or character, has a tendency to the good of mankind, we are pleas’d with it, and approve of it; because it presents the lively idea of pleasure; which idea affects us by sympathy, and is itself a kind of pleasure. But as this sympathy is very variable, it may be thought, <OPB num="213"/>that our senti<MPB ed="SBN" num="581"/>ments of morals must admit of all the same variations. We sympathize more with persons contiguous to us, than with persons remote from us: With our acquaintance, than with strangers: With our countrymen, than with foreigners. But notwithstanding this variation of our sympathy, we give the same approbation to the same moral qualities in <em>China</em> as in <em>England</em>. They appear equally virtuous, and recommend themselves equally to the esteem of a judicious spectator. The sympathy varies without a variation in our esteem. Our esteem, therefore, proceeds not from sympathy.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.15"><para><sc>To</sc> this I answer: The approbation of moral qualities most certainly is not deriv’d from reason, or any comparison of ideas; but proceeds entirely from a moral taste, and from certain sentiments of pleasure or disgust, which arise upon the contemplation and view of particular qualities or characters. Now ’tis evident, that those sentiments, whence-ever they are deriv’d, must vary according to the distance or contiguity of the objects; nor can I feel the same lively pleasure from the virtues of a person, who liv’d in <em>Greece</em> two thousand years ago, that I feel from the virtues of a familiar friend and acquaintance. Yet I do not say, that I <OPB num="214"/>esteem the one more than the other: And therefore, if the variation of the sentiment, without a variation of the esteem, be an objection, it must have equal force against every other system, as against that of sympathy. But to consider the <del>matter</del><ins comment="originally 'matter'; manuscript alteration">case</ins> a-right, it has no force at all; and ’tis the easiest matter in the world to account for it. Our situation, with regard both to persons and things, is in continual fluctuation; and a man, that lies at a distance from us, may, in a little time, become a familiar acquaintance. Besides, every particular man has a peculiar position with regard to others; and ’tis impossible we cou’d ever converse together on any reasonable terms, were each of us to consider characters and persons, only as they appear from his peculiar point of view. In order, therefore, to prevent those continual <em>contradictions</em>, and arrive at a more <em>stable</em> judgment of things, we fix on some <em>steady</em> and <em>general</em> <MPB ed="SBN" num="582"/>points of view; and always, in our thoughts, place ourselves in them, whatever may be our present situation. In like manner, external beauty is determin’d merely by pleasure; and ’tis evident, a beautiful countenance cannot give so much pleasure, when seen at the distance of twenty paces, as when it is brought nearer us. We <OPB num="215"/>say not, however, that it appears to us less beautiful: Because we know what effect it will have in such a position, and by that reflection we correct its momentary appearance.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.16"><para><sc>In</sc> general, all sentiments of blame or praise are variable, according to our situation of nearness or remoteness, with regard to the person blam’d or prais’d, and according to the present disposition of our mind. But these variations we regard not in our general decisions, but still apply the terms expressive of our liking or dislike, in the same manner, as if we remain’d in one point of view. Experience soon teaches us this method of correcting our sentiments, or at least, of correcting our language, where the sentiments are more stubborn and inalterable. Our servant, if diligent and faithful, may excite stronger sentiments of love and kindness than <em>Marcus Brutus</em>, as represented in history; but we say not upon that account, that the former character is more laudable than the latter. We know, that were we to approach equally near to that renown’d patriot, he wou’d command a much higher degree of affection and admiration. Such corrections are common with regard to all the senses; and indeed ’twere impossible <OPB num="216"/>we cou’d ever make use of language, or communicate our sentiments to one another, did we not correct the momentary appearances of things, and overlook our present situation.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.17"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> therefore from the influence of characters and qualities, upon those who have an intercourse with any person, that we blame or praise him. We consider not whether the persons, affected by the qualities, be our acquaintance or strangers, countrymen or foreigners. Nay, we over-look our own interest in those general judgments; and blame not <MPB ed="SBN" num="583"/>a man for opposing us in any of our pretensions, when his own interest is particularly concern’d. We make allowance for a certain degree of selfishness in men; because we know it to be inseparable from human nature, and inherent in our frame and constitution. By this reflection we correct those sentiments of blame, which so naturally arise upon any opposition.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.18"><para><sc>But</sc> however the general principle of our blame or praise may be corrected by those other principles, ’tis certain, they are not altogether efficacious, nor do our passions often correspond entirely to the present theory. ’Tis seldom men heartily love what lies at a distance from them, and what no <OPB num="217"/>way redounds to their particular benefit; as ’tis no less rare to meet with persons, who can pardon another any opposition he makes to their interest, however justifiable that opposition may be by the general rules of morality. Here we are contented with saying, that reason requires such an impartial conduct, but that ’tis seldom we can bring ourselves to it, and that our passions do not readily follow the determination of our judgment. This language will be easily understood, if we consider what we formerly said concerning that <em>reason</em>, which is able to oppose our passion; and which we have found to be nothing but a general calm determination of the passions, founded on some distant view or reflection. When we form our judgments of persons, merely from the tendency of their characters to our own benefit, or to that of our friends, we find so many contradictions to our sentiments in society and conversation, and such an uncertainty from the incessant changes of our situation, that we seek some other standard of merit and demerit, which may not admit of so great variation. Being thus loosen’d from our first station, we cannot afterwards fix ourselves so commodiously by any means as by a sympathy with those, who have any <OPB num="218"/>commerce with the person we consider. This is far from being as lively as when our own interest is concern’d, or that of our particular friends; nor <MPB ed="SBN" num="584"/>has it such an influence on our love and hatred: But being equally conformable to our calm and general principles, ’tis said to have an equal authority over our reason, and to command our judgment and opinion. We blame equally a bad action, which we read of in history, with one perform’d in our neighbourhood t’other day: The meaning of which is, that we know from reflection, that the former action wou’d excite as strong sentiments of disapprobation as the latter, were it plac’d in the same position.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.19"><para><sc>I now</sc> proceed to the <em>second</em> remarkable circumstance, which I propos’d to take notice of. Where a person is possess’d of a character, that in its natural tendency is beneficial to society, we esteem him virtuous, and are delighted with the view of his character, even tho’ particular accidents prevent its operation, and incapacitate him from being serviceable to his friends and country. Virtue in rags is still virtue; and the love, which it procures, attends a man into a dungeon or desart, where the virtue can no longer be exerted in action, and is lost to <OPB num="219"/>all the world. Now this may be esteem’d an objection to the present system. Sympathy interests us in the good of mankind; and if sympathy were the source of our esteem for virtue, that sentiment of approbation cou’d only take place, where the virtue actually attain’d its end, and was beneficial to mankind. Where it fails of its end, ’tis only an imperfect means; and therefore can never acquire any merit from that end. The goodness of an end can bestow a merit on such means alone as are compleat, and actually produce the end.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.20"><para><sc>To</sc> this we may reply, that where any object, in all its parts, is fitted to attain any agreeable end, it naturally gives us pleasure, and is esteem’d beautiful, even tho’ some external circumstances be wanting to render it altogether effectual. ’Tis sufficient if every thing be compleat in the object itself. A house, that is contriv’d with great judgment for all the commodities of life, pleases us upon that account; tho’ perhaps we are sensible, that no-one will ever dwell in it. <MPB ed="SBN" num="585"/>A fertile soil, and a happy climate, delight us by a reflection on the happiness which they wou’d afford the inhabitants, tho’ at present the country be desart and uninhabited. A man, whose limbs and shape promise strength <OPB num="220"/>and activity, is esteem’d handsome, tho’ condemn’d to perpetual imprisonment. The imagination has a set of passions belonging to it, upon which our sentiments of beauty much depend. These passions are mov’d by degrees of liveliness and strength, which are inferior to <em>belief</em>, and independent of the real existence of their objects. Where a character is, in every respect, fitted to be beneficial to society, the imagination passes easily from the cause to the effect, without considering that there are still some circumstances wanting to render the cause a compleat one. <em>General rules</em> create a species of probability, which sometimes influences the judgment, and always the imagination.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.21"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> true, when the cause is compleat, and a good disposition is attended with good fortune, which renders it really beneficial to society, it gives a stronger pleasure to the spectator, and is attended with a more lively sympathy. We are more affected by it; and yet we do not say that it is more virtuous, or that we esteem it more. We know, that an alteration of fortune may render the benevolent disposition entirely impotent; and therefore we separate, as much as possible, the fortune from the disposition. The case is the same, as when we correct <OPB num="221"/>the different sentiments of virtue, which proceed from its different distances from ourselves. The passions do not always follow our corrections; but these corrections serve sufficiently to regulate our abstract notions, and are alone regarded, when we pronounce in general concerning the degrees of vice and virtue.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.22"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> observ’d by critics, that all words or sentences, which are difficult to the pronunciation, are disagreeable to the ear. There is no difference, whether a man hear them pronounc’d, or read them silently to himself. When I run over a book with my eye, I imagine I hear it all; and also, <MPB ed="SBN" num="586"/>by the force of imagination, enter into the uneasiness, which the delivery of it wou’d give the speaker. The uneasiness is not real; but as such a composition of words has a natural tendency to produce it, this is sufficient to affect the mind with a painful sentiment, and render the <del>discourse</del><ins comment="originally 'discourse'; manuscript alteration">style</ins> harsh and disagreeable. ’Tis a similar case, where any real quality is, by accidental circumstances, render’d impotent, and is depriv’d of its natural influence on society.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.23"><para><sc>Upon</sc> these principles we may easily remove any contradiction, which may appear to be betwixt the <em>extensive sympathy</em>, on <OPB num="222"/>which our sentiments of virtue depend, and that <em>limited generosity</em> which I have frequently observ’d to be natural to men, and which justice and property suppose, according to the precedent reasoning. My sympathy with another may give me the sentiment of pain and disapprobation, when any object is presented, that has a tendency to give him uneasiness; tho’ I may not be willing to sacrifice any thing of my own interest, or cross any of my passions, for his satisfaction. A house may displease me by being ill-contriv’d for the convenience of the owner; and yet I may refuse to give a shilling towards the rebuilding of it. Sentiments must touch the heart, to make them controul our passions: But they need not extend beyond the imagination, to make them influence our taste. When a building seems clumsy and tottering to the eye, it is ugly and disagreeable; tho’ we be fully assur’d of the solidity of the workmanship. ’Tis a kind of fear, which causes this sentiment of disapprobation; but the passion is not the same with that which we feel, when oblig’d to stand under a wall, that we really think tottering and insecure. The <em>seeming tendencies</em> of objects affect the mind: And the emotions they excite are of a like <OPB num="223"/>species with those, which proceed from the <em>real consequences</em> of objects, but their feeling is different. Nay, these emotions are so different in their feeling that they may often be contrary, without destroying each other; as when the fortifications of a city belonging to an enemy are esteem’d beautiful <MPB ed="SBN" num="587"/>upon account of their strength, tho’ we cou’d wish that they were entirely destroy’d. The imagination adheres to the <em>general</em> views of things, and distinguishes <del>the feelings they procude, from</del><ins comment="originally 'the feelings they produce, from'; manuscript alteration">betwixt the feelings they produce, and</ins> those which arise from our particular and momentary situation.<br/></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.24"><para><sc>If</sc> we examine the panegyrics that are commonly made of great men, we shall find, that most of the qualities, which are attributed to them, may be divided into two kinds, <em>viz.</em> such as make them perform their part in society; and such as render them serviceable to themselves, and enable them to promote their own interest. Their <em>prudence</em>, <em>temperance</em>, <em>frugality</em>, <em>industry</em>, <em>assiduity</em>, <em>enterprize</em>, <em>dexterity</em>, are celebrated, as well as their <em>generosity</em> and <em>humanity</em>. If we ever give an indulgence to any quality, that disables a man from making a figure in life, ’tis to that of <em>indolence</em>,  which is not suppos’d to deprive one of his parts and ca<OPB num="224"/>pacity, but only suspends their exercise; and that without any inconvenience to the person himself, since ’tis, in some measure, from his own choice. Yet indolence is always allow’d to be a fault, and a very great one, if extreme: Nor do a man’s friends ever acknowledge him to be subject to it, but in order to save his character in more material articles. He cou’d make a figure, say they, if he pleas’d to give application: His understanding is sound, his conception quick, and his memory tenacious; but he hates business, and is indifferent about his fortune. And this a man sometimes may make even a subject of vanity; tho’ with the air of confessing a fault: Because he may think, that this incapacity for business implies much more noble qualities; such as a philosophical spirit, a fine taste, a delicate wit, or a relish for pleasure and society. But take any other case: Suppose a quality, that without being an indication of any other good qualities, incapacitates a man <em>always</em> for business, and is destructive to his interest; such as a blundering understanding, and a wrong judgment of every thing in life; inconstancy <MPB ed="SBN" num="588"/>and irresolution; or a want of address in the management of men and business: These are all allow’d to be imperfec<OPB num="225"/>tions in a character; and many men wou’d rather acknowledge the greatest crimes, than have it suspected, that they are, in any degree, subject to them.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.25"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> very happy, in our philosophical researches, when we find the same ph<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>nomenon diversified by a variety of circumstances; and by discovering what is common among them, can the better assure ourselves of the truth of any hypothesis we may make use of to explain <del>it</del><ins comment="originally 'it'; manuscript alteration">that phaenomenon</ins>. Were nothing esteem’d virtue but what were beneficial to society, I am persuaded, that the foregoing explication of the moral sense ought still to be receiv’d, and that upon sufficient evidence: But this evidence must grow upon us, when we find other kinds of virtue, which will not admit of any explication except from that hypothesis. Here is a man, who is not remarkably defective in his social qualities; but what principally recommends him is his dexterity in business, by which be has extricated himself from the greatest difficulties, and conducted the most delicate affairs with a singular address and prudence. I find an esteem for him immediately to arise in me: His company is a satisfaction to me; and before I have any farther acquaintance with him, I wou’d rather do him a service <OPB num="226"/>than another, whose character is in every other respect equal, but is deficient in that particular. In this case, the qualities that please me are all consider’d as useful to the person, and as having a tendency to promote his interest and satisfaction. They are only regarded as means to an end, and please me in proportion to their fitness for that end. The end, therefore, must be agreeable to me. But what makes the end agreeable? The person is a stranger: I am no way interested in him, nor lie under any obligation to him: His happiness concerns not me, farther than the happiness of every human, and indeed of every sensible creature: That is, it affects me only by sympathy. From that principle, whenever I discover his happiness and good, whether in its causes <MPB ed="SBN" num="589"/>or effects, I enter so deeply into it, that it gives me a sensible emotion. The appearance of qualities, that have a <em>tendency</em> to promote it, have an agreeable effect upon my imagination, and command my love and esteem.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.26"><para><sc>This</sc> theory may serve to explain, why the same qualities, in all cases, produce both pride and love, humility and hatred; and the same man is always virtuous or vicious, accomplish’d or despicable to others, <OPB num="227"/>who is so to himself. A person, in whom we discover any passion or habit, which originally is only incommodious to himself, becomes always disagreeable to us, merely on its account; as on the other hand, one whose character is only dangerous and disagreeable to others, can never be satisfied with himself, as long as he is sensible of that disadvantage. Nor is this observable only with regard to characters and manners, but may be remark’d even in the most minute circumstances. A violent cough in another gives us uneasiness; tho’ in itself it does not in the least affect us. A man will be mortified, if you tell him he has a stinking breath; tho’ ’tis evidently no annoyance to himself. Our fancy easily changes its situation; and either surveying ourselves as we appear to others, or considering others as they feel themselves, <del>we</del><ins comment="originally 'we'; manuscript alteration">makes us</ins> enter, by that means, into sentiments, which no way belong to us, and in which nothing but sympathy is able to interest us. And this sympathy we sometimes carry so far, as even to be displeas’d with a quality commodious to us, merely because it displeases others, and <del>makes</del><ins comment="originally 'makes'; manuscript alteration">renders</ins> us disagreeable in their eyes; tho’ perhaps we never can have any interest in rendering ourselves agreeable to them.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.27"><para><sc>There</sc> have been many systems of morality advanc’d by philosophers in all ages; but if they are strictly examin’d, they may be reduc’d to two, which alone merit our attention. Moral good and evil are certainly distinguish’d by our <em>sentiments</em>, not by <em>reason:</em> But these sentiments may arise either from the mere species or appearance of characters and passions, or from reflections on their tendency to the happiness of mankind, and of particular persons. My opinion is, <MPB ed="SBN" num="590"/>that both these causes are intermix’d in our judgments of morals; after the same manner as they are in our decisions concerning most kinds of external beauty: Tho’ I am also of opinion, that reflections on the tendencies of actions have by far the greatest influence, and determine all the great lines of our duty. There are, however, instances, in cases of less moment, wherein this immediate taste or sentiment produces our approbation. Wit, and a certain easy and disengag’d behaviour, are qualities  <em>immediately agreeable</em> to others, and command their love and esteem. Some of these qualities produce satisfaction in others by particular <em>original</em> principles of human nature, which cannot be accounted for: Others may be resolv’d into principles, <OPB num="229"/>which are more general. This will best appear upon a particular enquiry.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.28"><para><sc>As</sc> some qualities acquire their merit from their being <em>immediately agreeable</em> to others, without any tendency to public interest; so some are denominated virtuous from their being <em>immediately agreeable</em> to the person himself, who possesses them. Each of the passions and operations of the mind has a particular feeling, which must be either agreeable or disagreeable. The first is virtuous, the second vicious. This particular feeling constitutes the very nature of the passion; and therefore needs not be accounted for.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.29"><para><sc>But</sc> however directly the distinction of vice and virtue may seem to flow from the immediate pleasure or uneasiness, which particular qualities cause to ourselves or others; ’tis easy to observe, that it has also a considerable dependence on the principle of <em>sympathy</em> so often insisted on. We approve of a person, who is possess’d of qualities <em>immediately agreeable</em> to those, with whom he has any commerce; tho’ perhaps we ourselves never reap’d any pleasure from them. We also approve of one, who is possess’d of qualities, that are <em>immediately agreeable</em> to himself; tho’ they be of no service to <OPB num="230"/>any mortal. To account for this we must have recourse to the foregoing principles.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.30"><para><sc>Thus</sc>, to take a general review of the present hypothesis: <MPB ed="SBN" num="591"/>Every quality of the mind is denominated virtuous, which gives pleasure by the mere survey; as every quality, which produces pain, is call’d vicious. This pleasure and this pain may arise from four different sources. For we reap a pleasure from the view of a character, which is naturally fitted to be useful to others, or to the person himself, or which is agreeable to others, or to the person himself. One may, perhaps, be surpriz’d, that amidst all these interests and pleasures, we shou’d forget our own, which <del>touches</del><ins comment="originally 'touches'; ERRATA and manuscript alteration">touch</ins> us so nearly on every other occasion. But we shall easily satisfy ourselves on this head, when we consider, that every particular person’s pleasure and interest being different, ’tis impossible men cou’d ever agree in their sentiments and judgments, unless they chose some common point of view, from which they might survey their object, and which might cause it to appear the same to all of them. Now, in judging of characters, the only interest <del>and</del><ins comment="originally 'and'; ERRATA and manuscript alteration">or</ins> pleasure, which appears the same to every spectator, is that of the person himself, whose character is examin’d; or that <OPB num="231"/>of persons, who have a connexion with him. And tho’ such interests and pleasures touch us more faintly than our own, yet being more constant and universal, they counter-ballance the latter even in practice, and are alone admitted in speculation as the standard of virtue and morality. They alone produce that particular feeling or sentiment, on which moral distinctions depend.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.1.31"><para><sc>As</sc> to the good or ill desert of virtue or vice, ’tis an evident consequence of the sentiments of pleasure or uneasiness. These sentiments produce love or hatred; and love or hatred, by the original constitution of human passion, is attended with benevolence or anger; that is, with a desire of making happy the person we love, and miserable the person we hate. We have treated of this more fully on another occasion.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2"><MPB ed="SBN" num="592"/><title><h3><wide>SEC</wide>T.<wide> </wide>II.</h3><h4><em>Of greatness of mind.</em></h4></title></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.1"><para><ac><dc>I</dc>t</ac> may now be proper to illustrate this general system of morals, by applying it to particular instances of virtue and vice, and shewing how their merit or demerit <OPB num="232"/>arises from the four sources here explain’d. We shall begin with examining the passions of <em>pride</em> and <em>humility</em>, and shall consider the vice or virtue that lies in their excesses or just proportion. An excessive pride or over-weaning conceit of ourselves is always esteem’d vicious, and is universally hated; as modesty, or a just sense of our weakness, is esteem’d virtuous, and procures the good-will of every-one. Of the four sources of moral distinctions, this is to be ascrib’d to the <em>third</em>;  viz. the immediate agreeableness and disagreeableness of a quality to others, without any reflections on the tendency of that quality.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.2"><para><sc>In</sc> order to prove this, we must have recourse to two principles, which are very conspicuous in human nature. The <em>first</em> of these is the <em>sympathy</em>, and communication of sentiments and passions above-mention’d. So close and intimate is the correspondence of human souls, that no sooner any person approaches me, than he diffuses on me all his opinions, and draws along my judgment in a greater or lesser degree. And tho’, on many occasions, my sympathy with him goes not so far as entirely to change my sentiments, and way of thinking; yet it seldom is so weak as not to disturb the easy course <OPB num="233"/>of my thought, and give an authority to that opinion, which is recommended to me by his assent and approbation. Nor is it any way material upon what subject he and I employ our thoughts. Whether we judge of an indifferent person, or of my own character, my sympathy gives equal force to his decision: And even his sentiments of his own merit make me consider him in the same light, in which he regards himself.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.3"><MPB ed="SBN" num="593"/><para><sc>This</sc> principle of sympathy is of so powerful and insinuating a nature, that it enters into most of our sentiments and passions, and often takes place under the appearance of its contrary. For ’tis remarkable, that when a person opposes me in any sentiment, which I am strongly bent upon, and rouzes up my passion by contradiction, I have always a degree of sympathy with him, nor does my commotion proceed from any other origin. We may here observe an evident conflict or rencounter of opposite principles and passions. On the one side there is that passion or sentiment, which is natural to me; and ’tis observable, that the stronger this passion is, the greater is the commotion. There must also be some passion or sentiment on the other side; and this passion can proceed from nothing but sympathy. The <OPB num="234"/>sentiments of others can never affect us, but by becoming, in some measure, our own; in which case they operate upon us, by opposing and encreasing our passions, in the very same manner as if they had been originally deriv’d from our own temper and disposition. While they remain conceal’d in the minds of others, they can never have any influence upon us: And even when they are known, if they went no farther than the imagination, or conception; that faculty is so accustom’d to objects of every different kind, that a mere idea, tho’ contrary to our sentiments and inclinations, wou’d never alone be able to affect us.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.4"><para><sc>The</sc> <em>second</em> principle I shall take notice of is that of <em>comparison</em>, or the variation of our judgments concerning objects, according to the proportion they bear to those with which we compare them. We judge more of objects by comparison, than by their intrinsic worth and value; and regard every thing as mean, when set in opposition to what is superior of the same kind. But no comparison is more obvious than that with ourselves; and hence it is that on all occasions it takes place, and mixes with most of our passions. This kind of comparison is directly contrary to sympathy in its opera<OPB num="235"/>tion, as we have observ’d in treating of <em>compassion</em> <MPB ed="SBN" num="594"/>and <em>malice</em>.<footnote num="84" sym="a"/> <em>In all kinds of comparison an object makes us always receive from another, to which it is compar’d, a sensation contrary to what arises from itself in its direct and immediate survey. The direct survey of another’s pleasure naturally gives us pleasure; and therefore produces pain, when compar’d with our own. His pain, consider’d in itself, is painful; but augments the idea of our own happiness, and gives us pleasure.</em></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.5"><para><sc>Since</sc> then those principles of sympathy, and a comparison with ourselves, are directly contrary, it may be worth while to consider, what general rules can be form’d, beside the particular temper of the person, for the prevalence of the one or the other. Suppose I am now in safety at land, and wou’d willingly reap some pleasure from this consideration: I must think on the miserable condition of those who are at sea in a storm, and must endeavour to render this idea as strong and lively as possible, in order to make me more sensible of my own happiness. But whatever pains I may take, the comparison will never have an equal efficacy, <OPB num="236"/>as if I were really on<footnote num="85" sym="b"/> the shore, and saw a ship at a distance, tost by a tempest, and in danger every moment of perishing on a rock or sand-bank. But suppose this idea to become still more lively. Suppose the ship to be driven so near me, that I can perceive distinctly the horror, painted on the countenance of the seamen and passengers, hear their lamentable cries, see the dearest friends give their last adieu, or embrace with a resolution to perish in each others arms: No man has so savage a heart as to reap any pleasure from such a spectacle, or withstand the motions of the tenderest compassion and sympathy. ’Tis evident, therefore, there is a medium in this case; and that if the idea be too feint, it <MPB ed="SBN" num="595"/>has no influence by comparison; and on the other hand, if it be too strong, it operates on us entirely by sympathy, which is the contrary to comparison. Sympathy being the conversion of an idea into an impression, demands a greater force and vivacity in the idea than is requisite to comparison.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.6"><para><sc>All</sc> this is easily applied to the present subject. We sink very much in our own <OPB num="237"/>eyes, when in the presence of a great man, or one of a superior genius; and this humility makes a considerable ingredient in that <em>respect</em>, which we pay our superiors, according to our<footnote num="86" sym="c"/> foregoing reasonings on that passion. Sometimes even envy and hatred arise from the comparison; but in the greatest part of men, it rests at respect and esteem. As sympathy has such a powerful influence on the human mind, it causes pride to have, in some measure, the same effect as merit; and by making us enter into those elevated sentiments, which the proud man entertains of himself, presents that comparison, which is so mortifying and disagreeable. Our judgment does not entirely accompany him in the flattering conceit, in which he pleases himself; but still is so shaken as to receive the idea it presents, and to give it an influence above the loose conceptions of the imagination. A man, who, in an idle humour, wou’d form a notion of a person of a merit very much superior to his own, wou’d not be mortified by that fiction: But when a man, whom we are really persuaded to be of inferior merit, is presented to us; if we observe in him any extraordinary degree of pride and self-conceit; <OPB num="238"/>the firm persuasion he has of his own merit, takes hold of the imagination, and diminishes us in our own eyes, in the same manner, as if he were really possess’d of all the good qualities which he so liberally attributes to himself. Our idea is here precisely in that medium, which is requisite to make it operate on us by comparison. Were it accompanied with belief, and did the person appear to have the same merit, <MPB ed="SBN" num="596"/>which he assumes to himself, it wou’d have a contrary effect, and wou’d operate on us by sympathy. The influence of that principle wou’d then be superior to that of comparison, contrary to what happens where the person’s merit seems below his pretensions.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.7"><para><sc>The</sc> necessary consequence of these principles is, that pride, or an over-weaning conceit of ourselves, must be vicious; since it causes uneasiness in all men, and presents them every moment with a disagreeable comparison. ’Tis a trite observation in philosophy, and even in common life and conversation, that ’tis our own pride, which makes us so much displeas’d with the pride of other people; and that vanity becomes insupportable to us merely because we are vain. The gay naturally associate themselves with the gay, and the amorous with the <OPB num="239"/>amorous: But the proud never can endure the proud, and rather seek the company of those who are of an opposite disposition. As we are, all of us, proud in some degree, pride is universally blam’d and condemn’d by all mankind; as having a natural tendency to cause uneasiness in others by means of comparison. And this effect must follow the more naturally, that those, who have an ill-grounded conceit of themselves, are for ever making those comparisons, nor have they any other method of supporting their vanity. A man of sense and merit is pleas’d with himself, independent of all foreign considerations: But a fool must always find some person, that is more foolish, in order to keep himself in good humour with his own parts and understanding.<br/></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.8"><para><sc>But</sc> tho’ an over-weaning conceit of our own merit be vicious and disagreeable, nothing can be more laudable, than to have a value for ourselves, where we really have qualities that are valuable. The utility and advantage of any quality to ourselves is a source of virtue, as well as its agreeableness to others; and ’tis certain, that nothing is more useful to us in the conduct of life, than a due degree of pride, which <MPB ed="SBN" num="597"/>makes <OPB num="240"/>us sensible of our own merit, and gives us a confidence and assurance in all our projects and enterprizes. Whatever capacity any one may be endow’d with, ’tis entirely useless to him, if he be not acquainted with it, and form not designs suitable to it. ’Tis requisite on all occasions to know our own force; and were it allowable to err on either side, twou’d be more advantageous to overrate our merit, than to form ideas of it, below its just standard. Fortune commonly favours the bold and enterprizing; and nothing inspires us with more boldness than a good opinion of ourselves.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.9"><para><sc>Add</sc> to this, that tho’ pride, or self-applause, be sometimes disagreeable to others, ’tis always agreeable to ourselves; as on the other hand, modesty, tho’ it give pleasure to every one, who observes it, produces often uneasiness in the person endow’d with it. Now it has been observ’d, that our own sensations determine the vice and virtue of any quality, as well as those sensations, which it may excite in others.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.10"><para><sc>Thus</sc> self-satisfaction and vanity may not only be allowable, but requisite in a character. ’Tis, however, certain, that good-breeding and decency require that we shou’d avoid all signs and expressions, which tend <OPB num="241"/>directly to show that passion. We have, all of us, a wonderful partiality for ourselves, and were we always to give vent to our sentiments in this particular, we shou’d mutually cause the greatest indignation in each other, not only by the immediate presence of so disagreeable a subject of comparison, but also by the contrariety of our judgments. In like manner, therefore, as we establish the <em>laws of nature</em>, in order to secure property in society, and prevent the opposition of self-interest; we establish the <em>rules of good-breeding</em>, in order to prevent the opposition of men’s pride, and render conversation agreeable and inoffensive. Nothing is more disagreeable than a man’s over-weaning conceit of himself: Every one almost has a strong propensity to this vice: No one can well distinguish <MPB ed="SBN" num="598"/><em>in himself</em> betwixt the vice and virtue, or be certain, that his esteem of his own merit is well-founded: For these reasons, all direct expressions of this passion are condemn’d; nor do we make any exception to this rule in favour of men of sense and merit. They are not allow’d to do themselves justice openly, in words, no more than other people; and even if they show a reserve and secret doubt in doing themselves justice in <OPB num="242"/>their own thoughts, they will be more applauded. That impertinent, and almost universal propensity of men, to over-value themselves, has given us such a <em>prejudice</em> against self-applause, that we are apt to condemn it, by a <em>general rule</em>, wherever we meet with it; and ’tis with some difficulty we give a privilege to men of sense, even in their most secret thoughts. At least, it must be own’d, that some disguise in this particular is absolutely requisite; and that if we harbour pride in our breasts, we must carry a fair outside, and have the appearance of modesty and mutual deference in all our conduct and behaviour. We must, on every occasion, be ready to prefer others to ourselves; to treat them with a kind of deference, even tho’ they be our equals; to seem always the lowest and least in the company, where we are not very much distinguish’d above them: And if we observe these rules in our conduct, men will have more indulgence for our secret sentiments, when we discover them in an oblique manner.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.11"><para><sc>I believe</sc> no one, who has any practice of the world, and can penetrate into the inward sentiments of men, will assert, that the humility, which good-breeding and decency require of us, goes beyond the out<OPB num="243"/>side, or that a thorough sincerity in this particular is esteem’d a real part of our duty. On the contrary, we may observe, that a genuine and hearty pride, or self-esteem, if well conceal’d and well founded, is essential to the character of a man of honour, and that there is no quality of the mind, which is more indispensibly requisite to procure the esteem and approbation of mankind. There are certain deferences and mutual submissions, which custom <MPB ed="SBN" num="599"/>requires of the different ranks of men towards each other; and whoever exceeds in this particular, if thro’ interest, is accus’d of meanness; if thro’ ignorance, of simplicity. ’Tis necessary, therefore, to know our rank and station in the world, whether it be fix’d by our birth, fortune, employments, talents or reputation. ’Tis necessary to feel the sentiment and passion of pride in conformity to it, and to regulate our actions accordingly. And shou’d it be said, that prudence may suffice to regulate our actions in this particular, without any real pride, I wou’d observe, that here the object of prudence is to conform our actions to the general usage and custom; and that ’tis impossible those tacit airs of superiority shou’d ever have been establish’d <OPB num="244"/>and authoriz’d by custom, unless men were generally proud, and unless that passion were generally approv’d, when well-grounded.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.12"><para><sc>If</sc> we pass from common life and conversation to history, this reasoning acquires new force, when we observe, that all those great actions and sentiments, which have become the admiration of mankind, are founded on nothing but pride and self-esteem. <em>Go</em>, says <em>Alexander</em> the Great to his soldiers, when they refus’d to follow him to the <em>Indies</em>, <em>go tell your countrymen, that you left Alexander compleating the conquest of the world</em>. This passage was always particularly admir’d by the prince of <em>Conde</em>, as we learn from <em>St. Evremond</em>. “<em>Alexander</em>,” said that prince, “abandon’d by his soldiers, among barbarians, not yet fully subdu’d, felt in himself such a dignity and right of empire, that he cou’d not believe it possible any one cou’d refuse to obey him. Whether in <em>Europe</em> or in <em>Asia</em>, among <em>Greeks</em> or <em>Persians</em>, all was indifferent to him: Wherever he found men, he fancied he had found subjects.”</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.13"><para><sc>In</sc> general we may observe, that whatever we call <em>heroic virtue</em>, and admire under the character of greatness and elevation of mind, is either nothing but a steady and well-establish’d pride and self-esteem, or <OPB num="245"/>partakes largely of that passion. Courage, intrepidity, ambition, love of glory, mag<MPB ed="SBN" num="600"/>nanimity, and all the other shining virtues of that kind, have plainly a strong mixture of self-esteem in them, and derive a great part of their merit from that origin. Accordingly we find, that many religious declaimers decry those virtues as purely pagan and natural, and represent to us the excellency of the <em>Christian</em> religion, which places humility in the rank of virtues, and corrects the judgment of the world, and even of philosophers, who so generally admire all the efforts of pride and ambition. Whether this virtue of humility has been rightly understood, I shall not pretend to determine. I am content with the concession, that the world naturally esteems a well-regulated pride, which secretly animates our conduct, without breaking out into such indecent expressions of vanity, as may offend the vanity of others.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.14"><para><sc>The</sc> merit of pride or self-esteem is deriv’d from two circumstances, <em>viz.</em> its utility and its agreeableness to ourselves; by which it capacitates us for business, and, at the same time, gives us an immediate satisfaction. When it goes beyond its just bounds, it loses the first advantage, and even becomes pre<OPB num="246"/>judicial; which is the reason why we condemn an extravagant pride and ambition, however regulated by the decorums of good-breeding and politeness. But as such a passion is still agreeable, and conveys an elevated and sublime sensation to the person, who is actuated by it, the sympathy with that satisfaction diminishes considerably the blame, which naturally attends its dangerous influence on <del>our</del><ins comment="originally 'our'; ERRATA and manuscript alteration">his</ins> conduct and behaviour. Accordingly we may observe, that an excessive courage and magnanimity, especially when it displays itself under the frowns of fortune, contributes, in a great measure, to the character of a hero, and will render a person the admiration of posterity; at the same time, that it ruins his affairs, and leads him into dangers and difficulties, with which otherwise he wou’d never have been acquainted.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.15"><para><sc>Heroism</sc>, or military glory, is much admir’d by the generality of mankind. They consider it as the most sublime kind of merit. Men of cool reflection are not so <MPB ed="SBN" num="601"/>sanguine in their praises of it. The infinite confusions and disorder, which it has caus’d in the world, diminish much of its merit in their eyes. When they wou’d oppose the popular notions on this head, they <OPB num="247"/>always paint out the evils, which this suppos’d virtue has produc’d in human society; the subversion of empires, the devastation of provinces, the sack of cities. As long as these are present to us, we are more inclin’d to hate than admire the ambition of heroes. But when we fix our view on the person himself, who is the author of all this mischief, there is something so dazzling in his character, the mere contemplation of it so elevates the mind, that we cannot refuse it our admiration. The pain, which we receive from its tendency to the prejudice of society, is over-power’d by a stronger and more immediate sympathy.<br/></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.16"><para><sc>Thus</sc> our explication of the merit or demerit, which attends the degrees of pride or self-esteem, may serve as a strong argument for the preceding hypothesis, by shewing the effects of those principles above explain’d in all the variations of our judgments concerning that passion. Nor will this reasoning be advantageous to us only by shewing, that the distinction of vice and virtue arises from the <em>four</em> principles of the <em>advantage</em> and of the <em>pleasure</em> of the <em>person himself</em>, and of <em>others:</em> But may also afford us <OPB num="248"/>a strong proof of some under-parts of that hypothesis.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.2.17"><para><sc>No</sc> one, who duly considers of this matter, will make any scruple of allowing, that any piece of ill-breeding, or any expression of pride and haughtiness, is displeasing to us, merely because it shocks our own pride, and leads us by sympathy into a comparison, which causes the disagreeable passion of humility. Now as an insolence of this kind is blam’d even in a person who has always been civil to ourselves in particular; nay, in one, whose name is only known to us in history; it follows, that our disapprobation proceeds from a sympathy with others, and from the reflection, that such a character is highly displeasing and odious to every <MPB ed="SBN" num="602"/>one, who converses or has any intercourse with the person possest of it. We sympathize with those people in their uneasiness; and as their uneasiness proceeds in part from a sympathy with the person who insults them, we may here observe a double rebound of the sympathy; which is a principle very similar to what we have observ’d on another occasion<footnote num="87" sym="a"/>.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="T 3.3.3.2"><para><sc>When</sc> experience has once given us a competent knowledge of human affairs, and has taught us the proportion they bear to human passion, we perceive, that the generosity of men is very limited, and that it seldom extends beyond their friends and family, or, at most, beyond their native country. Being thus acquainted with the nature of man, we expect not any impossibilities from him; but confine our view to that narrow circle, in which any person moves, in order to form a judgment of his moral character. When the natural tendency of his passions leads him to be serviceable and useful within his sphere, we approve of his character, and love his person, by a sym<OPB num="250"/>pathy with the sentiments of those, who have a more particular connexion with him. We are quickly oblig’d to forget our own interest in our judgments of this kind, by reason of the perpetual contradictions, we meet with in society and conversation, from persons that are not plac’d in the same situation, and have not the same interest with ourselves. The only point of view, in which our sentiments concur with those of others, is, when we consider the tendency of any passion to the advantage or harm <MPB ed="SBN" num="603"/>of those, who have any immediate connexion or intercourse with the person possess’d of it. And tho’ this advantage or harm be often very remote from ourselves, yet sometimes ’tis very near us, and interests us strongly by sympathy. This concern we readily extend to other cases, that are resembling; and when these are very remote, our sympathy is proportionably weaker, and our praise or blame fainter and more doubtful. The case is here the same as in our judgments concerning external bodies. All objects seem to diminish by their distance: But tho’ the appearance of objects to our senses be the original standard, by which we judge of them, yet we do not say, that they actually diminish by the distance; but correcting the ap<OPB num="251"/>pearance by reflection, arrive at a more constant and establish’d judgment concerning them. In like manner, tho’ sympathy be much fainter than our concern for ourselves, and a sympathy with persons remote from us much fainter than that with persons near and contiguous; yet we neglect all these differences in our calm judgments concerning the characters of men. Besides, that we ourselves often change our situation in this particular, we every day meet with persons, who are in a different situation from ourselves, and who cou’d never converse with us on any reasonable terms, were we to remain constantly in that situation and point of view, which is peculiar to us. The intercourse of sentiments, therefore, in society and conversation, makes us form some general inalterable standard, by which we may approve or disapprove of characters and manners. And tho’ the <em>heart</em> does not always take part with those general notions, or regulate its love and hatred by them, yet are they sufficient for discourse, and serve all our purposes in company, in the pulpit, on the theatre, and in the schools.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.3.3"><para><sc>From</sc> these principles we may easily account for that merit, which is commonly ascrib’d to <em>generosity</em>, <em>humanity</em>, <em>compassion</em>, <OPB num="252"/><em>gratitude</em>, <em>friendship</em>, <em>fidelity</em>, <em>zeal</em>, <em>disinterestedness</em>, <em>liberality,</em> and all those other qualities, which form the character of good and benevolent. A propensity to the <MPB ed="SBN" num="604"/>tender passions makes a man agreeable and useful in all the parts of life; and gives a just direction to all his other qualities, which otherwise may become prejudicial to society. Courage and ambition, when not regulated by benevolence, are fit only to make a tyrant and public robber. ’Tis the same case with judgment and capacity, and all the qualities of that kind. They are indifferent in themselves to the interests of society, and have a tendency to the good or ill of mankind, according as they are directed by these other passions.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.3.4"><para><sc>As</sc> love is <em>immediately agreeable</em> to the person, who is actuated by it, and hatred <em>immediately disagreeable</em>; this may also be a considerable reason, why we praise all the passions that partake of the former, and blame all those that have any considerable share of the latter. ’Tis certain we are infinitely touch’d with a tender sentiment, as well as with a great one. The tears naturally start in our eyes at the conception of it; nor can we forbear giving a loose to the same tenderness towards the person who ex<OPB num="253"/>erts it. All this seems to me a proof, that our approbation has, in those cases, an origin different from the prospect of utility and advantage, either to ourselves or others. To which we may add, that men naturally, without reflection, approve of that character, which is most like their own. The man of a mild disposition and tender affections, in forming a notion of the most perfect virtue, mixes in it more of benevolence and humanity, than the man of courage and enterprize, who naturally looks upon a certain elevation of mind as the most accomplish’d character. This must evidently proceed from an <em>immediate</em> sympathy, which men have with characters similar to their own. They enter with more warmth into such sentiments, and feel more sensibly the pleasure, which arises from them.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.3.5"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> remarkable that nothing touches a man of humanity more than any instance of extraordinary delicacy in love or friendship, where a person is attentive to the smallest concerns of his friend, and is willing to sacrifice to them the <MPB ed="SBN" num="605"/>most considerable interest of his own. Such delicacies have little influence on society; because they make us regard the greatest trifles: But they are the more engaging, the more minute the concern is, and <OPB num="254"/>are a proof of the highest merit in any one, who is capable of them. The passions are so contagious, that they pass with the greatest facility from one person to another, and produce correspondent movements in all human breasts. Where friendship appears in very signal instances, my heart catches the same passion, and is warm’d by those warm sentiments, that display themselves before me. Such agreeable movements must give me an affection to every one that excites them. This is the case with every thing that is agreeable in any person. The transition from pleasure to love is easy: But the transition must here be still more easy; since the agreeable sentiment, which is excited by sympathy, is love itself; and there is nothing requir’d but to change the object.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.3.6"><para><sc>Hence</sc> the peculiar merit of benevolence in all its shapes and appearances. Hence even its weaknesses are virtuous and amiable; and a person, whose grief upon the loss of a friend were excessive, wou’d be esteem’d upon that account.

<dhot id="T 3.3.3.7"><para><sc>We</sc> are not, however, to imagine, that all the angry passions are vicious, tho’ they are disagreeable. There is a certain indul<OPB num="255"/>gence due to human nature in this respect. Anger and hatred are passions inherent in our very frame and constitution. The want of them, on some occasions, may even be a proof of weakness and imbecillity. And where they appear only in a low degree, we not only excuse them because they are natural; but even bestow our applauses on them, because they are inferior to what appears in the greatest part of mankind.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.3.8"><para><sc>Where</sc> these angry passions rise up to cruelty, they form the most detested of all vices.

<dhot id="T 3.3.3.9"><para><sc>Even</sc> when the vice of inhumanity rises not to this extreme degree, our sentiments concerning it are very much influenc’d by reflections on the harm that results from it. And we may observe in general, that if we can find any quality in a person, which renders him incommodious to those, who live and converse with him, we always allow it to be a fault or blemish, without any farther examination. On the other hand, when we enumerate the good qualities of any person, we always mention those parts of his character, <OPB num="256"/>which render him a safe companion, an easy friend, a gentle master, an agreeable husband, or an indulgent father. We consider him with all his relations in society; and love or hate him, according as he affects those, who have any immediate intercourse with him. And ’tis a most certain rule, that if there be no relation of life, in which I cou’d not wish to stand to a particular person, his character must so far be allow’d to be perfect. If he be as little wanting to himself as to others, his character is entirely perfect. This is the ultimate test of merit and virtue.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="T 3.3.4.1"><para><ac><dc>N</dc>o</ac> distinction is more usual in all systems of ethics, than that betwixt <em>natural abilities</em> and <em>moral virtues</em>; where the former are plac’d on the same footing with bodily endowments, and are suppos’d to have no merit or moral worth annex’d to them. Whoever considers the matter accurately, will find, that a dispute upon this head wou’d be merely a dispute of words, <OPB num="257"/>and that tho’ these qualities are not altogether of the same kind, yet they agree in the most material circumstances. They are both of them equally mental qualities: And both of them equally produce pleasure; <MPB ed="SBN" num="607"/>and have of course an equal tendency to procure the love and esteem of mankind. There are few, who are not as jealous of their character, with regard to sense and knowledge, as to honour and courage; and much more than with regard to temperance and sobriety. Men are even afraid of passing for good-natur’d; lest <em>that</em> shou’d be taken for want of understanding: And often boast of more debauches than they have been really engag’d in, to give themselves airs of fire and spirit. In short, the figure a man makes in the world, the reception he meets with in company, the esteem paid him by his acquaintance; all these advantages depend almost as much upon his good sense and judgment, as upon any other part of his character. Let a man have the best intentions in the world, and be the farthest from all injustice and violence, he will never be able to make himself be much regarded, without a moderate share, at least, of parts and understanding. Since then natural abilities, tho’, perhaps, inferior, yet are on the <OPB num="258"/>same footing, both as to their causes and effects, with those qualities which we call moral virtues, why shou’d we make any distinction betwixt them?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.4.2"><para><sc>Tho</sc>’ we refuse to natural abilities the title of virtues, we must allow, that they procure the love and esteem of mankind; that they give a new lustre to the other virtues; and that a man possess’d of them is much more intitled to our good-will and services, than one entirely void of them. It may, indeed, be pretended, that the sentiment of approbation, which those qualities produce, besides its being <em>inferior</em>, is also somewhat <em>different</em> from that, which attends the other virtues. But this, in my opinion, is not a sufficient reason for excluding them from the catalogue of virtues. Each of the virtues, even benevolence, justice, gratitude, integrity, excites a different sentiment or feeling in the spectator. The characters of <em>C<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>sar</em> and <em>Cato</em>, as drawn by <em>Sallust</em>, are both of them virtuous, in the strictest sense of the word; but in a different way: Nor are the sentiments entirely the same, which arise from them. The one produces love; the other <MPB ed="SBN" num="608"/>esteem: The one is amiable; the other awful: We cou’d wish to meet with the one character in a friend; the other cha<OPB num="259"/>racter we wou’d be ambitious of in ourselves. In like manner, the approbation, which attends natural abilities, may be somewhat different to the feeling from that, which arises from the other virtues, without making them entirely of a different species. And indeed we may observe, that the natural abilities, no more than the other virtues, produce not, all of them, the same kind of approbation. Good sense and genius beget esteem: Wit and humour excite love<footnote num="88" sym="a"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.4.3"><para><sc>Those</sc>, who represent the distinction betwixt natural abilities and moral virtues as very material, may say, that the former are entirely involuntary, and have therefore no merit attending them, as having no dependance on liberty and free-will. But to this I answer, <em>first</em>, that many of those qualities, which all moralists, especially the antients, comprehend under the title of moral virtues, are equally involuntary and necessary, with the qualities of the judgment and imagina<OPB num="260"/>tion. Of this nature are constancy, fortitude, magnanimity; and, in short, all the qualities which form the <em>great</em> man. I might say the same, in some degree, of the others; it being almost impossible for the mind to change its character in any considerable article, or cure itself of a passionate or splenetic temper, when they are natural to it. The greater degree there is of these blameable qualities, the more vicious they become, and yet they are the less voluntary. <em>Secondly</em>, I wou’d have any one give me a reason, why virtue and vice may not be involuntary, as well as beauty and deformity. These moral distinctions arise from the natural distinctions of pain and pleasure; and when we receive those feelings from the general consideration of <MPB ed="SBN" num="609"/>any quality or character, we denominate it vicious or virtuous. Now I believe no one will assert, that a quality can never produce pleasure or pain to the person who considers it, unless it be perfectly voluntary in the person who possesses it. <em>Thirdly</em>, As to free-will, we have shewn that it has no place with regard to the actions, no more than the qualities of men. It is not a just consequence, that what is voluntary is free. Our actions are more voluntary than our judgments; but we <OPB num="261"/>have not more liberty in the one than in the other.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.4.4"><para><sc>But</sc> tho’ this distinction betwixt voluntary and involuntary be not sufficient to justify the distinction betwixt natural abilities and moral virtues, yet the former distinction will afford us a plausible reason, why moralists have invented the latter. Men have observ’d, that tho’ natural abilities and moral qualities be in the main on the same footing, there is, however, this difference betwixt them, that the former are almost invariable by any art or industry; while the latter, or at least the actions, that proceed from them, may be chang’d by the motives of reward and punishment, praise and blame. Hence legislators, and divines, and moralists, have principally applied themselves to the regulating these voluntary actions, and have endeavour’d to produce additional motives for being virtuous in that particular. They knew, that to punish a man for folly, or exhort him to be prudent and sagacious, wou’d have but little effect; tho’ the same punishments and exhortations, with regard to justice and injustice, might have a considerable influence. But as men, in common life and conversation, do not carry those ends in view, but naturally praise or blame <OPB num="262"/>whatever pleases or displeases them, they do not seem much to regard this distinction, but consider prudence under the character of virtue as well as benevolence, and penetration as well as justice. Nay, we find, that all moralists, whose judgment is not perverted by a strict adherence to a system, enter into the same way of thinking; and that the antient moralists in particular made no scruple of placing prudence at the head of the cardinal virtues. <MPB ed="SBN" num="610"/>There is a sentiment of esteem and approbation, which may be excited, in some degree, by any faculty of the mind, in its perfect state and condition; and to account for this sentiment is the business of <em>Philosophers</em>. It belongs to <em>Grammarians</em> to examine what qualities are entitled to the denomination of <em>virtue</em>; nor will they find, upon trial, that this is so easy a task, as at first sight they may be apt to imagine.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.4.5"><para><sc>The</sc> principal reason why natural abilities are esteem’d, is because of their tendency to be useful to the person, who is possess’d of them. ’Tis impossible to execute any design with success, where it is not conducted with prudence and discretion; nor will the goodness of our intentions alone suffice to procure us a happy issue to our enterprizes. <OPB num="263"/>Men are superior to beasts principally by the superiority of their reason; and they are the degrees of the same faculty, which set such an infinite difference betwixt one man and another.

<dhot id="T 3.3.4.8"><para><sc>As</sc> wisdom and good-sense are valued, because they are <em>useful</em> to the person possess’d of them; so <em>wit</em> and <em>eloquence</em> are valued, because they are <em>immediately agreeable</em> to others. On the other hand, <em>good humour</em> is lov’d and esteem’d, because it is <em>immediately agreeable</em> to the person himself. ’Tis evident, that the conversation of a man of wit is very satisfactory; as a chearful good-humour’d companion diffuses a joy over the whole company, from a sympathy with his gaiety. These qualities, therefore, being agreeable, they naturally beget love and esteem, and answer to all the characters of virtue.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.4.9"><para>’<sc>Tis</sc> difficult to tell, on many occasions, what it is that renders one man’s conversation so agreeable and entertaining, and another’s so insipid and distasteful. As conversation is a transcript of the mind as well as books, the same qualities, which render the one <OPB num="265"/>valuable, must give us an esteem for the other. This we shall consider afterwards. In the mean time it may be affirm’d in general, that all the merit a man may derive from his conversation (which, no doubt, may be very considerable) arises from nothing but the pleasure it conveys to those who are present.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.4.10"><para><sc>In</sc> this view, <em>cleanliness</em> is also to be regarded as a virtue; since it naturally renders us agreeable to others, and is a very considerable source of love and affection. No one will deny, that a negligence in this particular is a fault; and as faults are nothing but smaller vices, and this fault can have no other origin than the uneasy sensation, which it excites in others, we may in this instance, seemingly so trivial, clearly discover the origin of the moral distinction of vice and virtue in other instances.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.4.11"><para><sc>Besides</sc> all those qualities, which render a person lovely <MPB ed="SBN" num="612"/>or valuable, there is also a certain <em>je-ne-sçai-quoi</em> of agreeable and handsome, that concurs to the same effect. In this case, as well as in that of wit and eloquence, we must have recourse to a certain sense, which acts without reflection, and regards not the tendencies of qualities and characters. Some moralists account for all <OPB num="266"/>the sentiments of virtue by this sense. Their hypothesis is very plausible. Nothing but a particular enquiry can give the preference to any other hypothesis. When we find, that almost all the virtues have such particular tendencies; and also find, that these tendencies are sufficient alone to give a strong sentiment of approbation: We cannot doubt, after this, that qualities are approv’d of, in proportion to the advantage, which results from them.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.4.12"><para><sc>The</sc> <em>decorum</em> or <em>indecorum</em> of a quality, with regard to the age, or character, or station, contributes also to its praise or blame. This decorum depends, in a great measure, upon experience. ’Tis usual to see men lose their levity, as they advance in years. Such a degree of gravity, therefore, and such years, are connected together in our thoughts. When we observe them separated in any person’s character, this imposes a kind of violence on our imagination, and is disagreeable.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.4.13"><para><sc>That</sc> faculty of the soul, which, of all others, is of the least consequence to the character, and has the least virtue or vice in its several degrees, at the same time, that it admits of a great variety of degrees, is the <em>memory</em>. Unless it rise up to that stupen<OPB num="267"/>dous height as to surprize us, or sink so low as, in some measure, to affect the judgment, we commonly take no notice of its variations, nor ever mention them to the praise or dispraise of any person. ’Tis so far from being a virtue to have a good memory, that men generally affect to complain of a bad one; and endeavouring to persuade the world, that what they say is entirely of their own invention, sacrifice it to the praise of genius and judgment. Yet to consider the matter abstractedly, ’twou’d be <MPB ed="SBN" num="613"/>difficult to give a reason, why the faculty of recalling past ideas with truth and clearness, shou’d not have as much merit in it, as the faculty of placing our present ideas in such an order, as to form true propositions and opinions. The reason of the difference certainly must be, that the memory is exerted without any sensation of pleasure or pain; and in all its middling degrees serves almost equally well in business and affairs. But the least variations in the judgment are sensibly felt in their consequences; while at the same time that faculty is never exerted in any eminent degree, without an extraordinary delight and satisfaction. The sympathy with this utility and pleasure bestows a merit on the understanding; and the absence of it makes us <OPB num="268"/>consider the memory as a faculty very indifferent to blame or praise.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.4.14"><para><sc>Before</sc> I leave this subject of <em>natural abilities</em>, I must observe, that, perhaps, one source of the esteem and affection, which attends them, is deriv’d from the <em>importance</em> and <em>weight</em>,  which they bestow on the person possess’d of them. He becomes of greater consequence in life. His resolutions and actions affect a greater number of his fellow-creatures. Both his friendship and enmity are of moment. And ’tis easy to observe, that whoever is elevated, after this manner, above the rest of mankind, must excite in us the sentiments of esteem and approbation. Whatever is important engages our attention, fixes our thought, and is contemplated with satisfaction. The histories of kingdoms are more interesting than domestic stories: The histories of great empires more than those of small cities and principalities: And the histories of wars and revolutions more than those of peace and order. We sympathize with the persons that suffer, in all the various sentiments which belong to their fortunes. The mind is occupied by the multitude of the objects, and by the strong passions, that display themselves. And this occupation or agitation of the mind is <OPB num="269"/>commonly agreeable and amusing. The same theory accounts for the esteem and regard we pay to men of extraordinary parts and abilities. The good and <MPB ed="SBN" num="614"/>ill of multitudes are connected with their actions. Whatever they undertake is important, and challenges our attention. Nothing is to be over-look’d and despis’d, that regards them. And where any person can excite these sentiments, he soon acquires our esteem; unless other circumstances of his character render him odious and disagreeable.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="T 3.3.5.1"><para><ac><dc>I</dc>t</ac> has been observ’d, in treating of the passions, that pride and humility, love and hatred, are excited by any advantages or disadvantages of the <em>mind</em>, <em>body</em>, or <em>fortune</em>; and that these advantages or disadvantages have that effect by producing a separate impression of pain or pleasure. The pain or pleasure, which arises from the general survey or view of any action or quality of the <em>mind</em>, constitutes its vice or virtue, and gives <OPB num="270"/>rise to our approbation or blame, which is nothing but a fainter and more imperceptible love or hatred. We have assign’d four different sources of this pain and pleasure; and in order to justify more fully that hypothesis, it may here be proper to observe, that the advantages or disadvantages of the <em>body</em> and of <em>fortune</em>, produce a pain or pleasure from the very same principles. The tendency of any object to be <em>useful</em> to the person possess’d of it, or to others; to convey <em>pleasure</em> to him or to others; all these circumstances convey an immediate pleasure to the person, who considers the object, and command his love and approbation.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.5.2"><para><sc>To</sc> begin with the advantages of the <em>body</em>; we may observe a ph<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>nomenon, which might appear somewhat trivial and ludicrous, if any thing cou’d be trivial, which fortified a conclusion of such importance, or ludicrous, which was employ’d in a philosophical reasoning. ’Tis a general remark, that those we call good <em>women’s men</em>, who have either signaliz’d themselves by their amorous exploits, or whose make of body <MPB ed="SBN" num="615"/>promises any extraordinary vigour of that kind, are well received by the fair sex, and naturally engage the affections even of those whose virtue prevents any design of ever giving employment <OPB num="271"/>to those talents. Here ’tis evident, that the ability of such a person to give enjoyment, is the real source of that love and esteem he meets with among the females; at the same time that the women, who love and esteem him, have no prospect of receiving that enjoyment themselves, and can only be affected by means of their sympathy with one, that has a commerce of love with him. This instance is singular, and merits our attention.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.5.3"><para><sc>Another</sc> source of the pleasure we receive from considering bodily advantages, is their utility to the person himself, who is possess’d of them. ’Tis certain, that a considerable part of the beauty of men, as well as of other animals, consists in such a conformation of members, as we find by experience to be attended with strength and agility, and to capacitate the creature for any action or exercise. Broad shoulders, a lank belly, firm joints, taper legs; all these are beautiful in our species, because they are signs of force and vigour, which being advantages we naturally sympathize with, they convey to the beholder a share of that satisfaction they produce in the possessor.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.5.4"><para><sc>So</sc> far as to the <em>utility</em>, which may attend any quality of the body. As to the imme<OPB num="272"/>diate <em>pleasure</em>, ’tis certain, that an air of health, as well as of strength and agility, makes a considerable part of beauty; and that a sickly air in another is always disagreeable, upon account of that idea of pain and uneasiness, which it conveys to us. On the other hand, we are pleas’d with the regularity of our own features, tho’ it be neither useful to ourselves nor others; and ’tis necessary for us, in some measure, to set ourselves at a distance, to make it convey to us any satisfaction. We commonly consider ourselves as we appear in the eyes of others, and sympathize with the advantageous sentiments they entertain with regard to us.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.5.5"><MPB ed="SBN" num="616"/><para><sc>How</sc> far the advantages of <em>fortune</em> produce esteem and approbation from the same principles, we may satisfy ourselves by reflecting on our precedent reasoning on that subject. We have observ’d, that our approbation of those, who are possess’d of the advantages of fortune, may be ascrib’d to three different causes. <em>First</em>, To that immediate pleasure, which a rich man gives us, by the view of the beautiful cloaths, equipage, gardens, or houses, which he possesses. <em>Secondly</em>, To the advantage, which we hope to reap from him by his generosity and liberality. <em>Thirdly</em>, To the pleasure and advan<OPB num="273"/>tage, which he himself reaps from his possessions, and which produce an agreeable sympathy in us. Whether we ascribe our esteem of the rich and great to one or all of these causes, we may clearly see the traces of those principles, which give rise to the sense of vice and virtue. I believe most people, at first sight, will be inclin’d to ascribe our esteem of the rich to self-interest, and the prospect of advantage. But as ’tis certain, that our esteem or deference extends beyond any prospect of advantage to ourselves, ’tis evident, that that sentiment must proceed from a sympathy with those, who are dependent on the person we esteem and respect, and who have an immediate connexion with him. We consider him as a person capable of contributing to the happiness or enjoyment of his fellow-creatures, whose sentiments, with regard to him, we naturally embrace. And this consideration will serve to justify my hypothesis in preferring the <em>third</em> principle to the other two, and ascribing our esteem of the rich to a sympathy with the pleasure and advantage, which they themselves receive from their possessions. For as even the other two principles cannot operate to a due extent, or account for all the ph<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>nomena, without having recourse to a sym<OPB num="274"/>pathy of one kind or other; ’tis much more natural to chuse that sympathy, which is immediate and direct, than that which is remote and indirect. To which we may add, that where the riches or power are very great, and render the person considerable and important in the world, the <MPB ed="SBN" num="617"/>esteem attending them, may, in part, be ascrib’d to another source, distinct from these three, <em>viz.</em> their interesting the mind by a prospect of the multitude, and importance of their consequences: Tho’, in order to account for the operation of this principle, we must also have recourse to <em>sympathy</em>; as we have observ’d in the preceding section.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.5.6"><para><sc>It</sc> may not be amiss, on this occasion, to remark the flexibility of our sentiments, and the several changes they so readily receive from the objects, with which they are conjoin’d. All the sentiments of approbation, which attend any particular species of objects, have a great resemblance to each other, tho’ deriv’d from different sources; and, on the other hand, those sentiments, when directed to different objects, are different to the feeling, tho’ deriv’d from the same source. Thus the beauty of all visible objects causes a pleasure pretty much the same, tho’ it be sometimes deriv’d from the mere <em>species</em> and <OPB num="275"/>appearance of the objects; sometimes from sympathy, and an idea of their utility. In like manner, whenever we survey the actions and characters of men, without any particular interest in them, the pleasure, or pain, which arises from the survey (with some minute differences) is, in the main, of the same kind, tho’ perhaps there be a great diversity in the causes, from which it is deriv’d. On the other hand, a convenient house, and a virtuous character, cause not the same feeling of approbation; even tho’ the source of our approbation be the same, and flow from sympathy and an idea of their utility. There is something very inexplicable in this variation of our feelings; but ’tis what we have experience of with regard to all our passions and sentiments.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.6"><MPB ed="SBN" num="618"/><title><h3><wide>SEC</wide>T.<wide> </wide>VI.</h3><h4><em>Conclusion of this book.</em></h4></title></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.6.1"><para><ac><dc>T</dc>hus</ac> upon the whole I am hopeful, that nothing is wanting to an accurate proof of this system of ethics. We are certain, that sympathy is a very powerful principle in human nature. We are also <OPB num="276"/>certain, that it has a great influence on our sense of beauty, when we regard external objects, as well as when we judge of morals. We find, that it has force sufficient to give us the strongest sentiments of approbation, when it operates alone, without the concurrence of any other principle; as in the cases of justice, allegiance, chastity, and good-manners. We may observe, that all the circumstances requisite for its operation are found in most of the virtues; which have, for the most part, a tendency to the good of society, or to that of the person possess’d of them. If we compare all these circumstances, we shall not doubt, that sympathy is the chief source of moral distinctions; especially when we reflect, that no objection can be rais’d against this hypothesis in one case, which will not extend to all cases. Justice is certainly approv’d of for no other reason, than because it has a tendency to the public good: And the public good is indifferent to us, except so far as sympathy interests us in it. We may presume the like with regard to all the other virtues, which have a like tendency to the public good. They must derive all their merit from our sympathy with those, who reap any advantage from them: As the virtues, which have a <OPB num="277"/>tendency to the good of the person possess’d of them, derive their merit from our sympathy with him.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.6.2"><para><sc>Most</sc> people will readily allow, that the useful qualities of the mind are virtuous, because of their utility. This way of thinking is so natural, and occurs on so many occasions, that few will make any scruple of admitting it. Now this being once admitted, the force of sympathy must necessarily be <MPB ed="SBN" num="619"/>acknowledg’d. Virtue is consider’d as means to an end. Means to an end are only valued so far as the end is valued. But the happiness of strangers affects us by sympathy alone. To that principle, therefore, we are to ascribe the sentiment of approbation, which arises from the survey of all those virtues, that are useful to society, or to the person possess’d of them. These form the most considerable part of morality.<br/></para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.6.3"><para><sc>Were</sc> it proper in such a subject to bribe the readers assent, or employ any thing but solid argument, we are here abundantly supplied with topics to engage the affections. All lovers of virtue (and such we all are in speculation, however we may degenerate in practice) must certainly be pleas’d to see <OPB num="278"/>moral distinctions deriv’d from so noble a source, which gives us a just notion both of the <em>generosity</em> and <em>capacity</em> of <del>human</del><ins comment="originally 'human'; manuscript alteration">our</ins> nature. It requires but very little knowledge of human affairs to perceive, that a sense of morals is a principle inherent in the soul, and one of the most powerful that enters into the composition. But this sense must certainly acquire new force, when reflecting on itself, it approves of those principles, from whence it is deriv’d, and finds nothing but what is great and good in its rise and origin. Those who resolve the sense of morals into original instincts of the human mind, may defend the cause of virtue with sufficient authority; but want the advantage, which those possess, who account for that sense by an extensive sympathy with mankind. According to <del>their</del><ins comment="originally 'their'; manuscript alteration">the latter</ins> system, not only virtue must be approv’d of, but also the sense of virtue: And not only that sense, but also the principles, from whence it is deriv’d. So that nothing is presented on any side, but what is laudable and good.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.6.4"><para><sc>This</sc> observation may be extended to justice, and the other virtues of that kind. Tho’ justice be artificial, the sense of its morality is natural. ’Tis the combination of men, in a system of conduct, which renders <OPB num="279"/>any act of justice beneficial <MPB ed="SBN" num="620"/>to society. But when once it has that tendency, we <em>naturally</em> approve of it; and if we did not so, ’tis impossible any combination or convention cou’d ever produce that sentiment.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.6.5"><para><sc>Most</sc> of the inventions of men are subject to change. They depend upon humour and caprice. They have a vogue for a time, and then sink into oblivion. It may, perhaps, be apprehended, that if justice were allow’d to be a human invention, it must be plac’d on the same footing. But the cases are widely different. The interest, on which justice is founded, is the greatest imaginable, and extends to all times and places. It cannot possibly be serv’d by any other invention. It is obvious, and discovers itself on the very first formation of society. All these causes render the rules of justice stedfast and immutable; at least, as immutable as human nature. And if they were founded on original instincts, cou’d they have any greater stability?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T 3.3.6.6"><para><sc>The</sc> same system may help us to form a just notion of the <em>happiness</em>, as well as of the <em>dignity</em> of virtue, and may interest every principle of our nature in the embracing and cherishing that noble quality. Who indeed does not feel an accession of alacrity in <OPB num="280"/>his pursuits of knowledge and ability of every kind, when he considers, that besides the advantage, which immediately result from these acquisitions, they also give him a new lustre in the eyes of mankind, and are universally attended with esteem and approbation? And who can think any advantages of fortune a sufficient compensation for the least breach of the <em>social</em> virtues, when he considers, that not only his character with regard to others, but also his peace and inward satisfaction entirely depend upon his strict observance of them; and that a mind will never be able to bear its own survey, that has been wanting in its part to mankind and society? But I forbear insisting on this subject. Such reflections require a work a-part, very different from the genius of the present. The anatomist ought never to emulate the painter; nor in his accurate dissections and portraitures of the smaller parts of the human body, pretend <MPB ed="SBN" num="621"/>to give his figures any graceful and engaging attitude or expression. There is even something hideous, or at least minute in the views of things, which he presents; and ’tis necessary the objects shou’d be set more at a distance, and be more cover’d up from sight, to make them engaging to the eye and imagination. An <OPB num="281"/>anatomist, however, is admirably fitted to give advice to a painter; and ’tis even impracticable to excel in the latter art, without the assistance of the former. We must have an exact knowledge of the parts, their situation and connexion, before we can design with any elegance or correctness. And thus the most abstract speculations concerning human nature, however cold and unentertaining, become subservient to <em>practical morality</em>; and may render this latter science more correct in its precepts, and more persuasive in its exhortations.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="T App.1"><para><ac><dc>T</dc>here</ac> is nothing I wou’d more willingly lay hold of, than an opportunity of confessing my errors; and shou’d esteem such a return to truth and reason to be more honourable than the most unerring judgment. A man, who is free from mistakes, can pretend to no praises, except from the justness of his understanding: But a man, who corrects his mistakes, shews at once the justness of his understanding, and the candour and ingenuity of his temper. I have not yet been so fortunate as to discover any very considerable mistakes in the reasonings deliver’d in the preceding volumes, except on one article: But I have found by experience, that some of my expressions have not been so well chosen, as to guard against all mistakes in the readers; and ’tis chiefly to remedy this defect, I have subjoin’d the following appendix.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T App.2"><OPB num="284"/><para><sc>We</sc> can never be induc’d to believe any matter of fact, except where its cause, or its effect, is present to us; but what the nature is of that belief, which arises from the relation of cause and effect, few have had the curiosity to ask themselves. In my opinion, this dilemma is inevitable. Either the belief is some new idea, such as that of <em>reality</em> or <em>existence</em>, which we join to the simple conception of an object, or it is merely a peculiar <em>feeling</em> or <em>sentiment</em>. That it is not a new idea, annex’d to the simple conception, may be evinc’d from these two arguments. <em>First</em>, We have no abstract idea of existence, distinguishable and separable from the idea of particular objects. ’Tis impossible, therefore, that this idea of existence can be annex’d to the idea of any object, or form the difference betwixt a simple conception and belief. <em>Secondly</em>, The mind has the command over all its ideas, and <MPB ed="SBN" num="624"/>can separate, unite, mix, and vary them, as it pleases; so that if belief consisted merely in a new idea, annex’d to the conception, it wou’d be in a man’s power to believe what he pleas’d. We may, therefore, conclude, that belief consists merely in a certain feeling or sentiment; in something, that de<OPB num="285"/>pends not on the will, but must arise from certain determinate causes and principles, of which we are not masters. When we are convinc’d of any matter of fact, we do nothing but conceive it, along with a certain feeling, different from what attends the mere <em>reveries</em> of the imagination. And when we express our incredulity concerning any fact, we mean, that the arguments for the fact produce not that feeling. Did not the belief consist in a sentiment different from our mere conception, whatever objects were presented by the wildest imagination, wou’d be on an equal footing with the most establish’d truths founded on history and experience. There is nothing but the feeling, or sentiment, to distinguish the one from the other.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T App.3"><para><sc>This</sc>, therefore, being regarded as an undoubted truth, <em>that belief is nothing but a peculiar feeling, different from the simple conception</em>, the next question, that naturally occurs, is, <em>what is the nature of this feeling, or sentiment, and whether it be analogous to any other sentiment of the human mind?</em> This question is important. For if it be not analogous to any other sentiment, we must despair of explaining its causes, and must consider it as an original principle of the human <OPB num="286"/>mind. If it be analogous, we may hope to explain its causes from analogy, and trace it up to more general principles. Now that there is a greater firmness and solidity in the conceptions, which are the objects of conviction and assurance, than in the loose and indolent reveries of a castle-builder, every one will readily own. They strike upon us with more force; they are more present to us; the mind has a firmer hold of them, and is more actuated and mov’d by them. It acquiesces in them; and, in a manner, fixes and reposes itself on them. In short, they approach nearer to the im<MPB ed="SBN" num="625"/>pressions, which are immediately present to us; and are therefore analogous to many other operations of the mind.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T App.4"><para><sc>There</sc> is not, in my opinion, any possibility of evading this conclusion, but by asserting, that belief, beside the simple conception, consists in some impression or feeling, distinguishable from the conception. It does not modify the conception, and render it more present and intense: It is only annex’d to it, after the same manner that <em>will</em> and <em>desire</em> are annex’d to particular conceptions of good and pleasure. But the following considerations will, I hope, be sufficient to remove this hypothesis. <em>First</em>, It is <OPB num="287"/>directly contrary to experience, and our immediate consciousness. All men have ever allow’d reasoning to be merely an operation of our thoughts or ideas; and however those ideas may be varied to the feeling, there is nothing ever enters into our <em>conclusions</em> but ideas, or our fainter conceptions. For instance; I hear at present a person’s voice, whom I am acquainted with; and this sound comes from the next room. This impression of my senses immediately conveys my thoughts to the person, along with all the surrounding objects. I paint them out to myself as existent at present, with the same qualities and relations, that I formerly knew them possess’d of. These ideas take faster hold of my mind, than the ideas of an inchanted castle. They are different to the feeling; but there is no distinct or separate impression attending them. ’Tis the same case when I recollect the several incidents of a journey, or the events of any history. Every particular fact is there the object of belief. Its idea is modified differently from the loose reveries of a castle-builder: But no distinct impression attends every distinct idea, or conception of matter of fact. This is the subject of plain experience. If ever this experience can be disputed on any oc<OPB num="288"/>casion, ’tis when the mind has been agitated with doubts and difficulties; and afterwards, upon taking the object in a new point of view, or being presented with a new argument, fixes and reposes itself in one settled conclusion and belief. In this <MPB ed="SBN" num="626"/>case there is a feeling distinct and separate from the conception. The passage from doubt and agitation to tranquility and repose, conveys a satisfaction and pleasure to the mind. But take any other case. Suppose I see the legs and thighs of a person in motion, while some interpos’d object conceals the rest of his body. Here ’tis certain, the imagination spreads out the whole figure. I give him a head and shoulders, and breast and neck. These members I conceive and believe him to be possess’d of. Nothing can be more evident, than that this whole operation is perform’d by the thought or imagination alone. The transition is immediate. The ideas presently strike us. Their customary connexion with the present impression, varies them and modifies them in a certain manner, but produces no act of the mind, distinct from this peculiarity of conception. Let any one examine his own mind, and he will evidently find this to be the truth.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T App.5"><OPB num="289"/><para><em>Secondly</em>, Whatever may be the case, with regard to this distinct impression, it must be allow’d, that the mind has a firmer hold, or more steady conception of what it takes to be matter of fact, than of fictions. Why then look any farther, or multiply suppositions without necessity?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="T App.6"><para><em>Thirdly</em>, We can explain the <em>causes</em> of the firm conception, but not those of any separate impression. And not only so, but the causes of the firm conception exhaust the whole subject, and nothing is left to produce any other effect. An inference concerning a matter of fact is nothing but the idea of an object, that is frequently conjoin’d, or is associated with a present impression. This is the whole of it. Every part is requisite to explain, from analogy, the more steady conception; and nothing remains capable of producing any distinct impression.</para></dhot>

The transition from a present impression, always enlivens and strengthens any idea. When any object is presented, the idea of its usual attendant immediately strikes us, as something real and solid. ’Tis <em>felt</em>, rather than conceiv’d, and approaches the impression, from which it is deriv’d, in its force and influence.

For my part I must own, that I find a considerable difficulty in the case; and that even when I think I understand the subject perfectly, I am at a <OPB num="293"/>loss for terms to express my meaning. I conclude, by an induction which seems to me very evident, that an opinion or belief is nothing but an idea, that is different from a fiction, not in the nature, or the order of its parts, but in the <em>manner</em> of its being conceiv’d. But <MPB ed="SBN" num="629"/>when I wou’d explain this <em>manner</em>, I scarce find any word that fully answers the case, but am oblig’d to have recourse to every one’s feeling, in order to give him a perfect notion of this operation of the mind. An idea assented to <em>feels</em> different from a fictitious idea, that the fancy alone presents to us: And this different feeling I endeavour to explain by calling it a superior <em>force</em>, or <em>vivacity</em>, or <em>solidity</em>, or <em>firmness</em>, or <em>steadiness</em>. This variety of terms, which may seem so unphilosophical, is intended only to express that act of the mind, which renders realities more present to us than fictions, causes them to weigh more in the thought, and gives them a superior influence on the passions and imagination. Provided we agree about the thing, ’tis needless to dispute about the terms. The imagination has the command over all its ideas, and can join, and mix, and vary them in all the ways possible. It may conceive objects with all the circumstances of place and time. It may set them, <OPB num="294"/>in a manner, before our eyes in their true colours, just as they might have existed. But as it is impossible, that that faculty can ever, of itself, reach belief, ’tis evident, that belief consists not in the nature and order of our ideas, but in the manner of their conception, and in their feeling to the mind. I confess, that ’tis impossible to explain perfectly this feeling or manner of conception. We may make use of words, that express something near it. But its true and proper name is <em>belief</em>, which is a term that every one sufficiently understands in common life. And in philosophy we can go no farther, than assert, that it is something <em>felt</em> by the mind, which distinguishes the ideas of the judgment from the fictions of the imagination. It gives them more force and influence; makes them appear of greater importance; infixes them in the mind; and renders them the governing principles of all our actions.<br/></app></dhot>

But <OPB num="296"/>how great soever the pitch may be, to which this vivacity rises, ’tis evident, that in poetry it never has the same <em>feeling</em> with that which arises in the mind, when we reason, tho’ even upon the lowest species of probability. The mind can easily distinguish betwixt the one and the other; and whatever emotion the poetical enthusiasm may give to the spirits, ’tis still the mere phantom of belief or persuasion. The case is the same with the idea, as with the passion it occasions. There is no passion of the human <MPB ed="SBN" num="631"/>mind but what may arise from poetry; tho’ at the same time the <em>feelings</em> of the passions are very different when excited by poetical fictions, from what they are when they arise from belief and reality. A passion, which is disagreeable in real life, may afford the highest entertainment in a tragedy, or epic poem. In the latter case it lies not with that weight upon us: It feels less firm and solid: And has no other than the agreeable effect of exciting the spirits, and rouzing the attention. The difference in the passions is a clear proof of a like difference in those ideas, from which the passions are deriv’d. Where the vivacity arises from a customary conjunction with a present impression; tho’ the imagination may not, in appearance, be so <OPB num="297"/>much mov’d; yet there is always something more forcible and real in its actions, than in the fervors of poetry and eloquence. The force of our mental actions in this case, no more than in any other, is not to be measur’d by the apparent agitation of the mind. A poetical description may have a more sensible effect on the fancy, than an historical narration. It may collect more of those circumstances, that form a compleat image or picture. It may seem to set the object before us in more lively colours. But still the ideas it presents are different to the <em>feeling</em> from those, which arise from the memory and the judgment. There is something weak and imperfect amidst all that seeming vehemence of thought and sentiment, which attends the fictions of poetry. <br/><tab/><sc>We</sc> shall afterwards have occasion to remark both the resemblances and differences betwixt a poetical enthusiasm, and a serious conviction. In the mean time I cannot forbear observing, that the great difference in their feeling proceeds in some measure from reflection and <em>general rules</em>. We observe, that the vigour of conception, which fictions receive from poetry and eloquence, is a circumstance merely accidental, of which every idea is equally susceptible; and that such <OPB num="298"/>fictions are connected with nothing that is real. This observation makes us only lend ourselves, so to speak, to the <MPB ed="SBN" num="632"/>fiction: But causes the idea to feel very different from the eternal establish’d persuasions founded on memory and custom. They are somewhat of the same kind: But the one is much inferior to the other, both in its causes and effects. <br/><tab/><sc>A like</sc> reflection on <em>general rules</em> keeps us from augmenting our belief upon every encrease of the force and vivacity of our ideas. Where an opinion admits of no doubt, or opposite probability, we attribute to it a full conviction; tho’ the want of resemblance, or contiguity, may render its force inferior to that of other opinions. ’Tis thus the understanding corrects the appearances of the senses, and makes us imagine, that an object at twenty foot distance seems even to the eye as large as one of the same dimensions at ten.<br/></app></dhot>

The motions of our body, and the thoughts and sentiments of our mind, (say they) obey the will; nor do we seek any farther to acquire a just notion of force or power. But to convince us how fallacious this reasoning is, we need only consider, that the will being here consider’d as a cause, has no more a discoverable connexion with its effects, than any material cause has with its proper effect. So far from perceiving the connexion betwixt an act of volition, and a motion of the body; ’tis allow’d that no effect is more inexplicable from the powers and essence of thought and matter.

If perceptions are distinct existences, they form a whole only by being connected together. But no connexions among distinct existences are ever discoverable by human understanding.

It follows, therefore, that the thought alone finds personal identity, when reflecting on the train of past perceptions, that compose a mind, the ideas of them are felt to be connected together, and naturally introduce each other. However extraordinary this conclusion may seem, it need not surprize us. Most philosophers seem inclin’d to think, that personal identity <em>arises</em> from consciousness; and consciousness is nothing but a reflected thought or perception.

<dhot id="T n68"><note sym="a">One might think it were entirely superfluous to prove this, if a late author, who has had the good fortune to obtain some reputation, had not seriously affirmed, that such a falshood is the foundation of all guilt and moral deformity. That we may discover the fallacy of his hypothesis, we need only consider, that a false conclusion is drawn from an action, only by means of an obscurity of natural principles, which makes a cause be secretly interrupted in its operation, by contrary causes, and renders the connection betwixt two objects uncertain and variable. Now, as a like uncertainty and variety of causes take place, even in natural objects, and produce a like error in our judgment, if that tendency to produce error were the very essence of vice and immorality, it shou’d follow, that even inanimate objects might be vicious and immoral. <br/><tab/>’Tis in vain to urge, that inanimate objects act without liberty and choice. For as liberty and choice are not necessary to make an action produce in us an erroneous conclusion, they can be, in no respect, essential to morality; and I do not readily perceive, upon this system, how they can ever come to be regarded by it. If the tendency to cause error be the origin of immorality, that tendency and immorality wou’d in every case be inseparable. <br/><tab/>Add to this, that if I had used the precaution of shutting the windows, while I indulg’d myself in those liberties with my neighbour’s wife, I should have been guilty of no immorality; and that because my action, being perfectly conceal’d, wou’d have had no tendency to produce any false conclusion. <MPB ed="SBN" num="462"/><br/><tab/>For the same reason, a thief, who steals in by a ladder at a window, and takes all imaginable care to cause no disturbance, is in no respect criminal. For either he will not be perceiv’d, or if he be, ’tis impossible he can produce any error, nor will any one, from these circumstances, take him to be other than what he really is. <OPB num="13"/><br/><tab/>’Tis well known, that those who are squint-sighted, do very readily cause mistakes in others, and that we imagine they salute or are talking to one person, while they address themselves to another. Are they therefore, upon that account, immoral? <br/><tab/>Besides, we may easily observe, that in all those arguments there is an evident reasoning in a circle. A person who takes possession of <em>another</em>’s goods, and uses them as his <em>own</em>, in a manner declares them to be his own; and this falshood is the source of the immorality of injustice. But is property, or right, or obligation, intelligible, without an antecedent morality? <br/><tab/>A man that is ungrateful to his benefactor, in a manner affirms, that he never received any favours from him. But in what manner? Is it because ’tis his duty to be grateful? But this supposes, that there is some antecedent rule of duty and morals. Is it because human nature is generally grateful, and makes us conclude, that a man who does any harm never received any favour from the person he harm’d? But human nature is not so generally grateful, as to justify such a conclusion. Or if it were, is an exception to a general rule in every case criminal, for no other reason than because it is an exception? <br/><tab/>But what may suffice entirely to destroy this whimsical system is, that it leaves us under the same difficulty to give a reason why truth is virtuous and falshood vicious, as to account for the merit or turpitude of any other action. I shall allow, if you please, that all immorality is derived from this supposed falsehood in action, provided you can give me any plausible reason, why such a falshood is immoral. If you consider rightly of the matter, you will find yourself in the same difficulty as at the beginning. <br/><tab/>This last argument is very conclusive; because, if there be not an evident merit or turpitude annex’d to this species of truth or falshood, it can never have any influence upon our actions. For, who ever thought of forbearing any action, because others might possibly draw false conclusions from it? Or, who ever perform’d any, that he might give rise to true conclusions?</note></dhot>
<dhot id="T n69"><note sym="b">As a proof, how confus’d our way of thinking on this subject commonly is, we may observe, that those who assert, that morality is demonstrable, do not say, that morality lies in the relations, and that the relations are distinguishable by reason. They only say, that reason can discover such an action, in such relations, to be virtuous, and such another vicious. It seems they thought it sufficient, if they cou’d bring the word, Relation, into the proposition, without troubling themselves whether it was to the purpose or not. But here, I think, is plain argument. Demonstrative reason discovers only relations. But that reason, according to this hypothesis, discovers also vice and virtue. These moral qualities, therefore, must be relations. When we blame any action, in any situation, the whole complicated object, of action and situation, must form certain relations, wherein the essence of vice consists. This hypothesis is not otherwise intelligible. For what does reason discover, when it pronounces any action vicious? Does it discover a relation or a matter of fact? These questions are decisive, and must not be eluded.</note></dhot>

<dhot id="T n71"><note sym="a">No questions in philosophy are more difficult, than when a number of causes present themselves for the same ph<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>nomenon, to determine which is the principal and predominant. There seldom is any very precise argument to fix our choice, and men must be contented to be guided by a kind of taste or fancy, arising from analogy, and a comparison of similar instances. Thus, in the present case, there are, no doubt, motives of public interest for most of the rules, which determine property; but still I suspect, that these rules are principally fix’d by the imagination, or the more frivolous properties of our thought and conception. I shall continue to explain these causes, leaving it to the reader’s choice, whether he will prefer those deriv’d from publick utility, or those deriv’d from the imagination. We shall begin with the right of the present possessor. <br/><tab/>’Tis a quality, which <xref footnote="71a">(<em>a</em>)</xref> I have already observ’d in human nature, that when two objects appear in a close relation to each other, the mind is apt to ascribe to them any additional relation, in order to compleat the union; and this inclination is so strong, as often to make us run into errors (such as that of the conjunction of thought and matter) if we find that they can serve to that purpose. Many of our impressions are incapable of place or local position; and yet those very impressions we suppose to have a local conjunction with the impressions of sight and touch, merely because they are conjoin’d by causation, and are already united in the imagination. Since, therefore, we can feign a new relation, and even an absurd one, in order to compleat any union, ’twill easily be imagin’d, that if there be any relations, which depend on the mind, ’twill readily conjoin them to any preceding relation, and unite, by a new bond, such objects as have already an union in the fancy. Thus for instance, we never fail, in our arrangement of bodies, to place those which are <em>resembling</em> in <em>contiguity</em> to each other, or at least in <em>cor<OPB num="84"/>respondent</em> points of view; because we feel a satisfaction in joining the relation of contiguity to that of resemblance, or the resemblance of situation to that of qualities. And this is easily accounted for from the known properties of human nature. When the mind is determin’d to join certain objects, but undetermin’d in its choice of the particular objects, it naturally turns its eye to such as are related together. They are already united in the mind: They present themselves at the same time to the conception; and instead of requiring any new reason for their conjunction, it wou’d require a very powerful reason to make us over-look this natural affinity. This we shall have occasion to explain more fully afterwards, when we come to treat of <em>beauty</em>. In the mean time, we may content ourselves with observing, that the same love of order and uniformity, which arranges the books in a library, and the chairs in a parlour, contributes to the formation of society, and to the well-being of mankind, by modifying the general rule concerning the stability of possession. <del>And as</del><ins comment="originally 'And as'; manuscript deletion">As</ins> property forms a relation betwixt a person and an object, ’tis natural to found it on some preceding relation; and as property is nothing but a constant possession, secur’d by the laws <MPB ed="SBN" num="505"/>of society, ’tis natural to add it to the present possession, which is a relation that resembles it. For this also has its influence. If it be natural to conjoin all sorts of relations, ’tis more so, to conjoin such relations as are resembling, and are related together.</note></dhot>

<dhot id="T n72"><note sym="b">Some philosophers account for the right of occupation, by saying, that every one has a property in his own labour; and when he joins that labour to any thing, it gives him the property of the whole: But, 1. There are several kinds of occupation, where we cannot be said to join our labour to the object we acquire: As when we possess a meadow by grazing our cattle upon it. 2. This accounts for the matter by means of <em>accession</em>; which is taking a needless circuit. 3. We cannot be said to join our labour to any thing <OPB num="86"/>but in a figurative sense. Properly speaking, <MPB ed="SBN" num="506"/>we only make an alteration on it by our labour. This forms a relation betwixt us and the object; and thence arises the property, according to the preceding principles.</note></dhot>
<dhot id="T n73"><note sym="c">If we seek a solution of these difficulties in reason and public interest, we never shall find satisfaction; and if we look for it in the imagination, ’tis evident, that the qualities, which operate upon that faculty, run so insensibly and gradually into each other, that ’tis impossible to give them any precise bounds or termination. The difficulties on this head must encrease, when we consider, that our judgment alters very sensibly, according to the subject, and that the same power and proximity will be deem’d possession in one case, which is not esteem’d such in another. A person, who has hunted a hare to the last degree of weariness, wou’d look upon it as an injustice for another to rush in before him, and seize his prey. But the same person, advancing to pluck an apple, that hangs within his reach, has no reason to complain, if another, more alert, passes <MPB ed="SBN" num="507"/>him, and takes possession. What is the reason of this difference, but that immobility, not being natural to the hare, but the effect of industry, forms in that case a strong relation with the hunter, which is wanting in the other? <br/><tab/>Here then it appears, that a certain and infallible power of enjoyment, without touch or some other sensible relation, often produces not property: And I farther observe, that a sensible relation, without any present power, is sometimes sufficient to give a title to any object. The sight of a thing is seldom a considerable relation, and is only regarded as such, when the object is hidden, or very obscure; in which case we find, that the view alone conveys a property; according to that maxim, <em>that even a whole continent belongs to the nation, which first discover’d it</em>. ’Tis however remarkable, <OPB num="88"/>that both in the case of discovery and that of possession, the first discoverer and possessor must join to the relation an intention of rendering himself proprietor, otherwise the relation will not have its effect; and that because the connexion in our fancy betwixt the property and the relation is not so great, but that it requires to be help’d by such an intention. <br/><tab/>From all these circumstances, ’tis easy to see how perplex’d many questions may become concerning the acquisition of property by occupation; and the least effort of thought may present us with instances, which are not susceptible of any reasonable decision. If we prefer examples, which are real, to such as are feign’d, we may consider the following one, which is to be met with in almost every writer, that has treated of the laws of nature. <del> </del><ins comment="the paragraph break here is a manuscript alteration"><br/><tab/></ins>Two <em>Grecian</em> colonies, leaving their native country, in search of new seats, were inform’d that a city near them was deserted by its inhabitants. To know the truth of this report, they dispatch’d at once <MPB ed="SBN" num="508"/>two messengers, one from each colony; who finding on their approach, that their information was true, begun a race together with an intention to take possession of the city, each of them for his countrymen. One of these messengers, finding that he was not an equal match for the other, launch’d his spear at the gates of the city, and was so fortunate as to fix it there before the arrival of his companion. This produc’d a dispute betwixt the two colonies, which of them was the proprietor of the empty city; and this dispute still subsists among philosophers. For my part I find the dispute impossible to be decided, and that because the whole question hangs upon the fancy, which in this case is not possess’d of any precise or determinate standard, upon which it can give sen<OPB num="89"/>tence. <del> </del><ins comment="the paragraph break here is a manuscript alteration"><br/><tab/></ins>To make this evident, let us consider, that if these two persons had been simply members of the colonies, and not messengers or deputies, their actions wou’d not have been of any consequence; since in that case their relation to the colonies wou’d have been but feeble and imperfect. Add to this, that nothing determin’d them to run to the gates rather than the walls, or any other part of the city, but that the gates, being the most obvious and remarkable part, satisfy the fancy best in taking them for the whole; as we find by the poets, who frequently draw their images and metaphors from them. Besides we may consider, that the touch or contact of the one messenger is not properly possession, no more than the piercing the gates with a spear; but only forms a relation; and there is a relation, in the other case, equally obvious, tho’ not, perhaps, of equal force. Which of these relations, then, conveys a right and property, or whether any of them be sufficient for that effect, I leave to the decision of such as are wiser than myself.</note></dhot>
<dhot id="T n74"><note sym="d">Present possession is plainly a relation betwixt a person and an object; but is not sufficient to counter-ballance the relation of first possession, unless the former be long and uninterrupted: In which case the relation is encreas’d on the side of the <OPB num="91"/>present possession, by the extent of time, and diminish’d on that of first possession, by the distance. This change in the relation produces a consequent change in the property.</note></dhot>
<dhot id="T n75"><note sym="e">This source of property can never be explain’d but from the imaginations; and one may affirm, that the causes are here unmix’d. We shall proceed to explain them more particularly, and illustrate them by examples from common life and experience. <br/><tab/>It has been observ’d above, that the mind has a natural propensity to join relations, especially resembling ones, and finds a kind of fitness and uniformity in such an union. From this propensity are deriv’d these laws of nature, <em>that upon the first formation of society, property always follows the present possession</em>; and afterwards, <em>that it arises from first or from long possession</em>. Now we may easily observe, that relation is not confin’d merely to one degree; but that from an object, that is related to us, we acquire a relation to every other object, which is related to it, and so on, till the thought loses the chain by too long a progress. However the relation may <OPB num="92"/>weaken by each remove, ’tis not immediately destroy’d; but frequently connects two objects by means of an intermediate one, which is related to both. And this principle is of such force as to give rise to the right of <em>accession</em>, and causes us to acquire the property not only of such objects as we are immediately possess’d of, but also of such as are closely connected with them. <br/><tab/>Suppose a <em>German</em>, a <em>Frenchman</em>, and a <em>Spaniard</em> to come into a room where there are plac’d upon the table three bottles of wine, <MPB ed="SBN" num="510"/><em>Rhenish</em>, <em>Burgundy</em> and <em>Port</em>; and suppose they shou’d fall a quarrelling about the division of them; a person, who was chosen for umpire, wou’d naturally, to shew his impartiality, give every one the product of his own country: And this from a principle, which, in some measure, is the source of those laws of nature, that ascribe property to occupation, prescription and accession. <br/><tab/>In all these cases, and particularly that of accession, there is first a <em>natural</em> union betwixt the idea of the person and that of the object, and afterwards a new and  <em>moral</em> union produc’d by that right or property, which we ascribe to the person. But here there occurs a difficulty, which merits our attention, and may afford us an opportunity of putting to tryal that singular method of reasoning, which has been employ’d on the present subject. I have already observ’d, that the imagination passes with greater facility from little to great, than from great to little, and that the transition of ideas is always easier and smoother in the former case than in the latter. Now as the right of accession arises from the easy transition of ideas, by which related objects are connected together, it shou’d naturally be imagin’d, that the right of accession must encrease in strength, in proportion as the transition of ideas is perform’d with greater facility. It may, therefore, be thought, that when we have acquir’d the property of any small object, we shall readily consider any great object related to it as an accession, and as belonging to the proprietor of the small one; since the transition is in that case very easy from the small object to the great one, and shou’d connect them together in the closest manner. But in fact the case is always found to <OPB num="93"/>be otherwise. The empire of <em>Great Britain</em> seems to draw along with it the dominion of the <em>Orkneys</em>, the  <em>Hebrides</em>, the isle of <em>Man</em>, and the isle of <em>Wight</em>; but the authority over those lesser islands does not naturally imply any title to  <em>Great Britain</em>. In short, a small object naturally follows a great one as its accession; but a great one is never suppos’d to belong to the proprietor of a small one related to it, merely on account of that property and relation. Yet in this latter case the transition of ideas is smoother from the proprietor to the small object, which is his property, and from the small object to the great one, than in the former case from the proprietor to the great object, and from the great one to the small. It may therefore be thought, that these ph<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>nomena are objections to the foregoing hypothesis, <em>that the ascribing of property to accession is nothing but an <del>affect</del><ins comment="originally 'affect'; clearly an error">effect</ins> of the relations of ideas, and of the smooth transition of the imagination</em>. <br/><tab/>’Twill be easy to solve this objection, if we consider the agility and unsteadiness of the imagination, with the different views, in which it is continually placing its objects. When we attribute to a person a property in two objects, we do not always pass from the person to one object, and from that to the other related to it. The objects being here to be consider’d as the property of the person, we are apt to join them <MPB ed="SBN" num="511"/>together, and place them in the same light. Suppose, therefore, a great and a small object to be related together; if a person be strongly related to the great object, he will likewise be strongly related to both the objects, consider’d together, because be is related to the most considerable part. On the contrary, if he be only related to the small object, he will not be strongly related to both, consider’d together, since his relation lies only with the most trivial part, which is not apt to strike us in any great degree, when we consider the whole. And this is the reason, why small objects become accessions to great ones, and not great to small. <br/><tab/>’Tis the general opinion of philosophers and civilians, that the sea is incapable of becoming the property of any nation; and that because ’tis impossible to take possession of it, or form any such distinct relation with it, as may be the foundation of <OPB num="94"/>property. Where this reason ceases, property immediately takes place. Thus the most strenuous advocates for the liberty of the seas universally allow, that friths and bays naturally belong as an accession to the proprietors of the surrounding continent. These have properly no more bond or union with the land, than the <em>pacific</em> ocean wou’d have; but having an union in the fancy, and being at the same time <em>inferior</em>, they are of course regarded as an accession. <br/><tab/>The property of rivers, by the laws of most nations, and by the natural turn of our thought, is attributed to the proprietors of their banks, excepting such vast rivers as the <em>Rhine</em> or the <em>Danube</em>, which seem too large to the imagination to follow as an accession the property of the neighbouring fields. Yet even these rivers are consider’d as the property of that nation, thro’ whose dominions they run; the idea of a nation being of a suitable bulk to correspond with them, and bear them such a relation in the fancy. <br/><tab/>The accessions, which are made to lands bordering upon rivers, follow the land, say the civilians, provided <del>it</del><ins comment="originally 'it'; manuscript alteration">they</ins> be made by what they call <em>alluvion</em>, that is, insensibly and imperceptibly; which are circumstances that mightily assist the imagination in the conjunction. Where there is any considerable portion torn at once from one bank, and join’d to another, it becomes not his property, whose land it falls on, till it unite with the land, and till the trees or plants have spread their roots into both. Before that, the imagination does not sufficiently join them. <br/><tab/>There are other cases, which somewhat resemble this of accession, but which, at the bottom, are considerably different, and merit our attention. Of this kind is the conjunction of the properties of different persons, after such a manner as not to admit of <em>separation</em>. The question is, to whom the united mass must belong. <br/><tab/>Where this conjunction is of such a nature as to admit of <em>division</em>, but not of <em>separation</em>, the decision is natural and easy. The whole mass must be suppos’d to be common betwixt the proprietors of the <MPB ed="SBN" num="512"/>several parts, and afterwards must be divided according to the proportions of these parts. But <OPB num="95"/>here I cannot forbear taking notice of a remarkable subtilty of the <em>Roman</em> law, in distinguishing betwixt <em>confusion</em> and <em>commixtion</em>. Confusion is an union of two bodies, such as different liquors, where the parts become entirely undistinguishable. Commixtion is the blending of two bodies, such as two bushels of corn, where the parts remain separate in an obvious and visible manner. As in the latter case the imagination discovers not so entire an union as in the former, but is able to trace and preserve a distinct idea of the property of each; this is the reason, why the <em>civil</em> law, tho’ it establish’d an entire community in the case of <em>confusion</em>, and after that a proportional division, yet in the case of <em>commixtion</em>, supposes each of the proprietors to maintain a distinct right; however necessity may at last force them to submit to the same division. <br/><tab/><em>Quod si frumentum Titii frumento tuo mistum fuerit: siquidem ex voluntate vestra, commune est: quia singula corpora, id est, singula grana, qu<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins> cujusque propria fuerunt, ex consensu vestro communicata sunt.

Tit. 1. §. 28. <br/><tab/>Where the properties of two persons are united after such a manner as neither to admit of <em>division</em> nor <em>separation</em>, as when one builds a house on another’s ground, in that case, the whole must belong to one of the proprietors: And here I assert, that it naturally is conceiv’d to belong to the proprietor of the most considerable part. For however the compound object may have a relation to two different persons, and carry our view at once to both of them, yet as the most considerable part principally engages our attention, and by the strict union draws the inferior along it; for this reason, the whole bears a relation to the proprietor of that part, and is regarded as his property. The only difficulty is, what we shall be pleas’d to call the most considerable part, and most attractive to the imagination. <OPB num="96"/><br/><tab/>This quality depends on several different circumstances, which have little connexion with each other. One part of a compound object may become more considerable than another, either because it is more constant and durable; because it is of greater value; because it is more obvious and remarkable; because it is of greater extent; or because its existence is more separate and independent. ’Twill be easy to conceive, that, as these circumstances may be conjoin’d and oppos’d in all the different ways, and according to all the different degrees, which can be <MPB ed="SBN" num="513"/>imagin’d, there will result many cases, where the reasons on both sides are so equally ballanc’d, that ’tis impossible for us to give any satisfactory decision. Here then is the proper business of municipal laws, to fix what the principles of human nature have left undetermin’d. <br/><tab/>The superficies yields to the soil, says the civil law: The writing to the paper: The canvas to the picture. These decisions do not well agree together, and are a proof of the contrariety of those principles, from which they are deriv’d. <br/><tab/>But of all the questions of this kind the most curious is that, which for so many ages divided the disciples of <em>Proculus</em> and <em>Sabinus</em>. Suppose a person shou’d make a cup from the metal of another, or a ship from his wood, and suppose the proprietor of the metal or wood shou’d demand his goods, the question is, whether he acquires a title to the cup or ship. <em>Sabinus</em> maintain’d the affirmative, and asserted that the substance or matter is the foundation of all the qualities; that it is incorruptible and immortal, and therefore superior to the form, which is casual and dependent. On the other hand, <em>Proculus</em> observ’d, that the form is the most obvious and remarkable part, and that from it bodies are denominated of this or that particular species. To which he might have added, that the matter or substance is in most bodies so fluctuating and uncertain, that ’tis utterly impossible to trace it in all its changes. For my part, I know not from what principles such a controversy can be certainly determin’d. I shall therefore content my self with observing, that the decision of <em>Trebonian</em> seems to me pretty ingenious; that the cup belongs to the proprietor of the metal, because it can be brought back to its first form: But that the ship belongs to the author of its form for a contrary reason. But however ingenious this rea<OPB num="97"/>son may seem, it plainly depends upon the fancy, which by the possibility of such a reduction, finds a closer connexion and relation betwixt a cup and the proprietor of its metal, than betwixt a ship and the proprietor of its wood, where the substance is more fix’d and unalterable.</note></dhot>

Mean while I shall rest contented with observing one example, which belongs to the present subject. Suppose that a person die without children, and that a dispute arises among his relations concerning his inheritance; ’tis evident, that if his riches be deriv’d partly from his father, partly from his mother, the most natural way of determining such a dispute, is, to divide his possessions, and assign each part to the family, from whence it is deriv’d. Now as the person is suppos’d to have been once the full and entire proprietor of those goods; I ask, what is it makes us find a certain equity and natural reason in this partition, except it be the imagination? His affection to these families does not depend upon his possessions; for which reason his consent can never be presum’d precisely for such a partition.

But as the moral obligation of a promise is the pure effect of the will, without the least change in any part of the universe; it follows, that promises have no <em>natural</em> obligation. <br/><tab/>Shou’d it be said, that this act of the will being in effect a new object, produces new relations and new duties; I wou’d answer, that this is a pure sophism, which may be detected by a very moderate share of accuracy and exactness. To will a new <MPB ed="SBN" num="518"/>obligation, is to will a new relation of objects; and therefore, if this new relation of objects were form’d by the volition itself, we shou’d in effect will the volition; which is plainly absurd and impossible. The will has here no object to which it cou’d tend; but must return upon itself <em>in infinitum</em>. The new obligation depends upon new relations. <OPB num="105"/>The new relations depend upon a new volition. The new volition has for object a new obligation, and consequently new relations, and consequently a new volition; which volition again has in view a new obligation, relation and volition, without any termination. ’Tis impossible, therefore, we cou’d ever will a new obligation; and consequently ’tis impossible the will cou’d ever accompany a promise, or produce a new obligation of morality.</note></dhot>
