<dhot id="M App4.1"><para><ac><dc>N</dc>othing</ac> is more usual than for philosophers to encroach upon the province of grammarians; and to engage in disputes of words, while they imagine that they are handling controversies of the deepest importance and concern. It was in order to avoid altercations, so frivolous and endless, that I endeavoured to state with the utmost caution the object of our present enquiry; and proposed simply to collect, on the one hand, a list of those mental qualities which are the object of love or esteem, and form a part of personal merit, and on the other hand, a catalogue of those qualities, which are the object of censure or reproach, and which detract from the character of the person, possessed of them; subjoining some reflections concerning the origin of these sentiments of praise or blame. On all occasions, where there might arise the least hesitation, I avoided the terms <em>virtue</em> and <em>vice</em>; because some of those qualities, which I classed among the objects of praise, receive, in the <sc>English</sc> language, the appellation of <em>talents</em>, rather than of virtues; as some of the blameable or censurable qualities are often called <em>defects</em>, rather than vices. It may now, perhaps, be expected, that, before we conclude this moral enquiry, we should exactly separate the one from the other; should mark the precise boundaries of virtues and <OPB num="366"/>talents, vices and defects; and should explain the reason and origin <MPB ed="SBN" num="313"/>of that distinction. But in order to excuse myself from this undertaking, which would, at last, prove only a grammatical enquiry, I shall subjoin the four following reflections, which shall contain all that I intend to say on the present subject.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.2"><para><em>First</em>, I do not find, that in the <sc>English</sc>, or any other modern tongue, the boundaries are exactly fixed between virtues and talents, vices and defects, or that a precise definition can be given of the one as contradistinguished from the other. Were we to say, for instance, that the esteemable qualities alone, which are voluntary, are entitled to the appellations of virtues; we should soon recollect the qualities of courage, equanimity, patience, self-command; with many others, which almost every language classes under this appellation, though they depend little or not at all on our choice. Should we affirm, that the qualities alone, which prompt us to act our part in society, are entitled to that honourable distinction; it must immediately occur, that these are indeed the most valuable qualities, and are commonly denominated the <em>social</em> virtues; but that this very epithet supposes, that there are also virtues of another species. Should we lay hold of the distinction between <em>intellectual</em> and <em>moral</em> endowments, and affirm the last alone to be the real and genuine virtues, because they alone lead to action; we should find, that many of those qualities, usually called intellectual virtues, such as prudence, penetration, discernment, discretion, had also a considerable influence on conduct. The distinction between the <em>heart</em> and the <em>head</em> may also be adopted: The qualities of the first may be defined such as in their immediate exertion are accompanied with a feeling of sentiment; and these alone may be called the genuine virtues: But industry, frugality, <OPB num="367"/>temperance, secrecy, perseverance, and many other laudable powers or habits, generally stiled virtues are exerted without any immediate sentiment in the person possessed of them; and are only known to him by their effects. It is fortunate, <MPB ed="SBN" num="314"/>amidst all this seeming perplexity, that the question, being merely verbal, cannot possibly be of any importance. A moral, philosophical discourse needs not enter into all these caprices of language, which are so variable in different dialects, and in different ages of the same dialect. But on the whole, it seems to me, that, though it is always allowed, that there are virtues of many different kinds, yet, when a man is called <em>virtuous</em>, or is denominated a man of virtue, we chiefly regard his social qualities, which are, indeed, the most valuable. It is, at the same time, certain, that any remarkable defect in courage, temperance, <del>œ</del><ins comment="originally 'œ'; separated to make searching the text easier">oe</ins>conomy, industry, understanding, dignity of mind, would bereave even a very good-natured, honest man of this honourable appellation. Who did ever say, except by way of irony, that such a one was a man of great virtue, but an egregious blockhead?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.3"><para>But, <em>secondly</em>, it is no wonder, that languages should not be very precise in marking the boundaries between virtues and talents, vices and defects; since there is so little distinction made in our internal estimation of them. It seems indeed certain, that the <em>sentiment</em> of conscious worth, the self-satisfaction proceeding from a review of a man’s own conduct and character; it seems certain, I say, that this sentiment, which, though the most common of all others, has no proper name in our language<footnote num="66" sym="*"/>, arises from the endowments of courage and capacity, industry and ingenuity, as well as from any other mental <OPB num="368"/>excellencies. Who, on the other hand, is not deeply mortified with reflecting on his own folly and dissoluteness, and feels not a secret sting <MPB ed="SBN" num="315"/>or compunction, whenever his memory presents any past occurrence, where he behaved with stupidity or ill-manners? No time can efface the cruel ideas of a man’s own foolish conduct, or of affronts, which cowardice or impudence has brought upon him. They still haunt his solitary hours, damp his most aspiring thoughts, and show him, even to himself, in the most contemptible and most odious colours imaginable.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.4"><para>What is there too we are more anxious to conceal from others than such blunders, infirmities, and meannesses, or more dread to have exposed by raillery and satire? And is not the chief object of vanity, our bravery or learning, our wit or breeding, our eloquence or address, our taste or abilities? These we display with care, if not with ostentation; and we commonly show more ambition of excelling in them, than even in the social virtues themselves, which are, in reality, of such superior excellence. Good-nature and honesty, especially the latter, are so indispensably required, that, though the greatest censure attends any violation of these duties, no eminent praise follows such common instances of them, as seem essential to the support of human society. And hence the reason, in my opinion, why, though men often extol so liberally the qualities of their heart, they are shy in commending the endowments of their head: Because the latter virtues, being supposed more rare and extraordinary, are observed to be the more usual objects of pride and self-conceit; and when boasted of, beget a strong suspicion of these sentiments.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.5"><para>It is hard to tell, whether you hurt a man’s character most by calling him a knave or a coward, and whether a <OPB num="369"/>beastly glutton or drunkard be not as odious and contemptible, as a selfish, ungenerous miser. Give me my choice, and I would rather, for my own happiness and self-enjoyment, have a friendly, humane heart, than possess all the other virtues of <sc>Demosthenes</sc> and <sc>Philip</sc> united: But <MPB ed="SBN" num="316"/>I would rather pass with the world for one endowed with extensive genius and intrepid courage, and should thence expect stronger instances of general applause and admiration. The figure which a man makes in life, the reception which he meets with in company, the esteem paid him by his acquaintance; all these advantages depend as much upon his good sense and judgment, as upon any other part of his character. Had a man the best intentions in the world, and were the farthest removed from all injustice and violence, he would never be able to make himself be much regarded, without a moderate share, at least, of parts and understanding.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.6"><para>What is it then we can here dispute about? If sense and courage, temperance and industry, wisdom and knowledge confessedly form a considerable part of <em>personal merit:</em> if a man, possessed of these qualities, is both better satisfied with himself, and better entitled to the good-will, esteem, and services of others, than one entirely destitute of them; if, in short, the <em>sentiments</em> are similar, which arise from these endowments and from the social virtues; is there any reason for being so extremely scrupulous about a <em>word</em>, or disputing whether they be entitled to the denomination of virtues? It may, indeed, be pretended, that the sentiment of approbation, which those accomplishments produce, besides its being <em>inferior</em>, is also somewhat <em>different</em> from that, which attends the virtues of justice and humanity. But this seems not a sufficient reason for ranking them entirely under different classes and appellations. The character of <sc>C<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>sar</sc> and <OPB num="370"/>that of <sc>Cato</sc>, as drawn by <sc>Sallust</sc>, are both of them virtuous, in the strictest and most limited sense of the word; but in a different way: Nor are the sentiments entirely the same, which arise from them. The one produces love; the other, esteem: The one is amiable; the other awful: We should wish to meet the one character in a friend; the other we should be ambitious of in <MPB ed="SBN" num="317"/>ourselves. In like manner the approbation, which attends temperance or industry or frugality, may be somewhat different from that which is paid to the social virtues, without making them entirely of a different species. And, indeed, we may observe, that these endowments, more than the other virtues, produce not, all of them, the same kind of approbation. Good sense and genius beget esteem and regard: Wit and humour excite love and affection<footnote num="67" sym="*"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.7"><para>Most people, I believe, will naturally, without premeditation, assent to the definition of the elegant and judicious poet. <blockquote>Virtue (for mere good-nature is a fool) <br/>Is sense and spirit with humanity<footnote num="68" sym="†"/>.</blockquote></para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.8"><para>What pretensions has a man to our generous assistance or good offices, who has dissipated his wealth in profuse expences, idle vanities, chimerical projects, dissolute pleasures, or extravagant gaming? These vices (for we scruple <MPB ed="SBN" num="318"/>not to call them such) bring misery unpitied, and contempt on every one addicted to them.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.9"><para><sc>Ach<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>us</sc>, a wise and prudent prince, fell into a fatal snare, which cost him his crown and life, after having used every reasonable precaution to guard himself against it. On that account, says the historian, he is a just <OPB num="371"/>object of regard and compassion: His betrayers alone of hatred and contempt<footnote num="69" sym="*"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.10"><para>The precipitate flight and improvident negligence of <sc>Pompey</sc>, at the beginning of the civil wars, appeared such notorious blunders to <sc>Cicero</sc>, as quite palled his friendship towards that great man. <em>In the same manner</em>, says he, <em>as want of cleanliness, decency, or discretion in a mistress are found to alienate our affections.</em> For so he expresses himself, where he talks, not in the character of a philosopher, but in that of a statesman and man of the world, to his friend <sc>Atticus</sc><footnote num="70" sym="†"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.11"><para>But the same Cicero, in imitation of all the ancient moralists, when he reasons as a philosopher, enlarges very much his ideas of virtue, and comprehends every laudable quality or endowment of the mind, under that honourable appellation. This leads to the <em>third</em> reflection, which we proposed to make, to wit, that the ancient moralists, the best models, made no material distinction among the different species of mental endowments and defects, but treated all alike under the appellation of virtues and vices, and made them indiscriminately the object of their moral reasonings. The <em>prudence</em> explained in <sc>Cicero</sc>’s <em>Offices</em><footnote num="71" sym="‡"/>, is that sagacity, which leads to the discovery of truth, and preserves us from error and mistake. <em>Magnanimity</em>, <em>temperance</em>, <em>decency</em>, are there also at large discoursed of. And as that eloquent moralist followed the common received division of the four cardinal virtues, our social duties <MPB ed="SBN" num="319"/>form but one head, in the general distribution of his subject<footnote num="72" sym="ǁ"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.12"><para>We need only peruse the titles of chapters in <sc>Aristotle</sc>’s Ethics to be convinced, that he ranks courage, <OPB num=""/>temperance, magnificence, magnanimity, modesty, prudence, and a manly openness, among the virtues, as well as justice and friendship.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.13"><para>To <em>sustain</em> and to <em>abstain</em>, that is, to be patient and continent, appeared to some of the ancients a summary comprehension of all morals.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.14"><para><sc>Epictetus</sc> has scarcely ever mentioned the sentiment of humanity and compassion, but in order to put his disciples on their guard against it. The virtue of the <em>Stoics</em> seems to consist chiefly in a firm temper and a sound understanding. With them, as with <sc>Solomon</sc> and the <MPB ed="SBN" num="320"/>eastern moralists, folly and wisdom are equivalent to vice and virtue.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.15"><para>Men will praise thee, says <sc>David</sc><footnote num="73" sym="*"/>, when thou dost well unto thyself. I hate a wise man, says the <sc>Greek</sc> poet, who is not wise to himself<footnote num="74" sym="†"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.16"><para><sc>Plutarch</sc> is no more cramped by systems in his philosophy than in his history. Where he compares the great men of <sc>Greece</sc> and <sc>Rome</sc>, he fairly sets in opposition all their blemishes and accomplishments of whatever kind, and omits nothing considerable, which can either depress or exalt their characters. His moral discourses contain the same free and natural censure of men and manners.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.17"><para>The character of <sc>Hannibal</sc>, as drawn by <sc>Livy</sc><footnote num="75" sym="‡"/>, is esteemed partial, but allows him many eminent virtues. Never was there a genius, says the historian, more equally fitted for those opposite offices of commanding and obeying; and it were, therefore, difficult to determine whether he rendered himself <em>dearer</em> to the general or to the army. To none would <sc>Hasdrubal</sc> entrust more <OPB num="373"/>willingly the conduct of any dangerous enterprize; under none, did the soldiers discover more courage and confidence. Great boldness in facing danger; great prudence in the midst of it. No labour could fatigue his body or subdue his mind. Cold and heat were indifferent to him: Meat and drink he sought as supplies to the necessities of nature, not as gratifications of his voluptuous appetites<del>?</del><ins comment="originally a question mark; the 1770 and 1772 editions have a colon">:</ins> Waking or rest he used indiscriminately, by night or by day.—These great <ac>virtues</ac> were balanced by great <ac>vices</ac>: Inhuman cruelty; perfidy more than <em>punic</em>; no truth, no faith, no regard to oaths, promises, or religion.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.18"><para>The character of <sc>Alexander</sc> the Sixth, to be found in <MPB ed="SBN" num="321"/><sc>Guicciardin</sc><footnote num="76" sym="*"/>, is pretty similar, but juster; and is a proof that even the moderns, where they speak naturally, hold the same language with the ancients. In this pope, says he, there was a singular capacity and judgment: Admirable prudence; a wonderful talent of persuasion; and in all momentous enterprizes, a diligence and dexterity incredible. But these <em>virtues</em> were infinitely overbalanced by his <em>vices</em>; no faith, no religion, insatiable avarice, exorbitant ambition, and a more than barbarous cruelty.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.19"><para><sc>Polybius</sc><footnote num="77" sym="†"/>, reprehending <sc>Tim<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>us</sc> for his partiality against <sc>Agathocles</sc>, whom he himself allows to be the most cruel and impious of all tyrants, says: If he took refuge in <sc>Syracuse</sc>, as asserted by that historian, flying the dirt and smoke and toil of his former profession of a potter; and if proceeding from such slender beginnings, he became master, in a little time, of all <sc>Sicily</sc>; brought the <sc>Carthaginian</sc> state into the utmost danger; and at last died in old age, and in possession of sovereign dig<OPB num="374"/>nity: Must he not be allowed something prodigious and extraordinary, and to have possessed great talents and capacity for business and action? His historian, therefore, ought not to have alone related what tended to his reproach and infamy; but also what might redound to his <ac>praise</ac> and <ac>honour</ac>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.20"><para>In general, we may observe, that the distinction of voluntary or involuntary was little regarded by the ancients in their moral reasonings; where they frequently treated the question as very doubtful, <em>whether virtue could be taught or not</em><footnote num="78" sym="*"/><em>?</em> They justly considered, that cowardice, meanness, levity, anxiety, impatience, folly, and many other qualities of the mind, might appear ridiculous and deformed, contemptible and odious, though independent of the will. Nor <MPB ed="SBN" num="322"/>could it be supposed, at all times, in every man’s power to attain every kind of mental, more than of exterior beauty.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.21"><para>And here there occurs the <em>fourth</em> reflection which I purposed to make, in suggesting the reason, why modern philosophers have often followed a course, in their moral enquiries, so different from that of the ancients. In later times, philosophy of all kinds, especially ethics, have been more closely united with theology than ever they were observed to be among the Heathens; and as this latter science admits of no terms of composition, but bends every branch of knowledge to its own purpose, without much regard to the ph<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>nomena of nature, or to the unbiassed sentiments of the mind, hence reasoning, and even language, have been warped from their natural course, and distinctions have been endeavoured to be established, where the difference of the objects was, in a <OPB num="375"/>manner, imperceptible. Philosophers, or rather divines under that disguise, treating all morals, as on a like footing with civil laws, guarded by the sanctions of reward and punishment, were necessarily led to render this circumstance, of <em>voluntary</em> or <em>involuntary</em>, the foundation of their whole theory. Every one may employ <em>terms</em> in what sense he pleases: But this, in the mean time, must be allowed, that <em>sentiments</em> are every day experienced of blame and praise, which have objects beyond the dominion of the will or choice, and of which it behoves us, if not as moralists, as speculative philosophers at least, to give some satisfactory theory and explication.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M App4.22"><para>A blemish, a fault, a vice, a crime; these expressions seem to denote different degrees of censure and disapprobation; which are, however, all of them, at the bottom, pretty nearly all the same kind of species. The explication of one will easily lead us into a just conception of the others; and it is of greater consequence to attend to things than to verbal appellations. That we owe a duty to ourselves is confessed even in the most vulgar system of morals; and it <MPB ed="SBN" num="323"/>must be of consequence to examine that duty, in order to see whether it bears any affinity to that which we owe to society. It is probable, that the approbation, attending the observance of both, is of a similar nature, and arises from similar principles; whatever appellation we may give to either of these excellencies.</para></dhot>
