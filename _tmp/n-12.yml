<dhot id="N 12.1"><para>We meet every day with people so sceptical with regard to history, that they assert it impossible for any nation ever to believe such absurd principles as those of <sc>Greek</sc> and <sc>Egyptian</sc> paganism; and at the same time so dogmatical with regard to religion, that they think the same absurdities are to be found in no other communion. <sc>Cambyses</sc> entertained like prejudices; and very impiously ridiculed, and even wounded, <sc>Apis</sc>, the great god of the <sc>Egyptians</sc>, who appeared to his profane senses nothing but a large spotted bull. But <sc>Herodotus</sc> judiciously ascribes this sally of passion to a real madness or disorder of the brain: Otherwise, says the historian, he never would have openly affronted any established worship. For on that head, continues he, every nation are best satisfied with their own, and think they have the advantage over every other nation.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.2"><para>It must be allowed, that the <sc>Roman</sc> Catholics are a very learned sect; and that no one communion, but that <OPB num="445"/>of the church of <sc>England</sc>, can dispute their being the most learned of all the Christian churches: Yet <sc>Averroes</sc>, the famous <sc>Arabian</sc>, who, no doubt, had heard of the <sc>Egyptian</sc> superstitions, declares, that, of all religions, the most absurd and nonsensical is that, whose votaries eat, after having created, their deity.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.3"><para>I believe, indeed, that there is no tenet in all paganism, which would give so fair a scope to ridicule as this of the <em>real presence:</em> For it is so absurd, that it eludes the force of all argument. There are even some pleasant stories of that kind, which, though somewhat profane, are commonly told by the Catholics themselves. One day, a priest, it is said, gave inadvertently, instead of the sacrament, a counter, which had by accident fallen among the holy wafers. The communicant waited patiently for some time, expecting it would dissolve on his tongue: But finding that it still remained entire, he took it off. <em>I wish,</em> cried he to the priest, <em>you have not committed some mistake: I wish you have not given me God the Father: He is so hard and tough there is no swallowing him.</em></para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.4"><para>A famous general, at that time in the <sc>Muscovite</sc> service, having come to <sc>Paris</sc> for the recovery of his wounds, brought along with him a young <sc>Turk</sc>, whom he had taken prisoner. Some of the doctors of the <sc>Sorbonne</sc> (who are altogether as positive as the dervises of <sc>Constantinople</sc>) thinking <MPB ed="Bea" num="68"/>it a pity, that the poor <sc>Turk</sc> should be damned for want of instruction, solicited <sc>Mustapha</sc> very hard to turn Christian, and promised him, for his encouragement, plenty of good wine in this world, and paradise in the next. These allurements were too powerful to be resisted; and therefore, having been well instructed and catechized, he at last agreed to receive the sacraments of baptism and the <OPB num="446"/>Lord’s supper. The priest, however, to make every thing sure and solid, still continued his instructions; and began the next day with the usual question, <em>How many Gods are there?</em> <em>None at all,</em> replies <sc>Benedict</sc>; for that was his new name. <em>How! None at all!</em> cries the priest. <em>To be sure,</em> said the honest proselyte. <em>You have told me all along that there is but one God: And yesterday I eat him.</em></para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.5"><para>Such are the doctrines of our brethren the Catholics. But to these doctrines we are so accustomed, that we never wonder at them: Though in a future age, it will probably become difficult to persuade some nations, that any human, two-legged creature could ever embrace such principles. And it is a thousand to one, but these nations themselves shall have something full as absurd in their own creed, to which they will give a most implicit and most religious assent.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.6"><para>I lodged once at <sc>Paris</sc> in the same <em>hotel</em> with an ambassador from <sc>Tunis</sc>, who, having passed some years at <sc>London</sc>, was returning home that way. One day I observed his <sc>Moorish</sc> excellency diverting himself under the porch, with surveying the splendid equipages that drove along; when there chanced to pass that way some <em>Capucin</em> friars, who had never seen a <sc>Turk</sc>; as he, on his part, though accustomed to the <sc>European</sc> dresses, had never seen the grotesque figure of a <em>Capucin:</em> And there is no expressing the mutual admiration, with which they inspired each other. Had the chaplain of the embassy entered into a dispute with these <sc>Franciscans</sc>, their reciprocal surprize had been of the same nature. Thus all mankind stand staring at one another; and there is no beating it into their heads, that the turban of the <sc>African</sc> is not just as good or as bad a fashion as the cowl of the <sc>European</sc>. <em>He is a very honest man,</em> <OPB num="447"/>said the prince of <sc>Sallee</sc>, speaking of de <sc>Ruyter</sc>, <em>It is a pity he were a Christian.</em></para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.7"><para>How can you worship leeks and onions? we shall suppose a <sc>Sorbonnist</sc> to say to a priest of <sc>Sais</sc>. If we worship them, replies the latter; at least, we do not, at the same time, eat them. But what strange objects of adoration are cats and monkies? says the learned doctor. They are at least as good as the relics or rotten bones of martyrs, answers his no less learned antagonist. Are you not mad, insists the Catholic, to cut one another’s throat about the preference of a <MPB ed="Bea" num="69"/>cabbage or a cucumber? Yes, says the pagan; I allow it, if you will confess, that those are still madder, who fight about the preference among volumes of sophistry, ten thousand of which are not equal in value to one cabbage or cucumber<footnote num="58" sym="*"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.8"><para>Every by-stander will easily judge (but unfortunately the by-standers are few) that, if nothing were requisite to establish any popular system, but exposing the absurdities of other systems, every votary of every superstition could give a sufficient reason for his blind and bigotted attachment to the principles in which he has been educated. But without so extensive a knowledge, on which to ground this assurance (and perhaps, better without it), there is not wanting a sufficient stock of religious zeal and faith among mankind. <sc>Diodorus Siculus</sc><footnote num="59" sym="†"/> gives a remarkable instance to this purpose, of which he was himself an eye-witness. While <sc>Egypt</sc> lay under the greatest terror of the <sc>Roman</sc> name, a legionary soldier having inadvertently been guilty of the sacrilegious impiety of killing a cat, the whole people rose upon him with the utmost fury; and all the efforts of the prince were not able to save him. The senate and people of <OPB num="448"/><sc>Rome</sc>, I am persuaded, would not, then, have been so delicate with regard to their national deities. They very frankly, a little after that time, voted <sc>Augustus</sc> a place in the celestial mansions; and would have dethroned every god in heaven, for his sake, had he seemed to desire it. <em>Presens divus habebitur <sc>Augustus</sc>,</em> says <sc>Horace</sc>. That is a very important point: And in other nations and other ages, the same circumstance has not been deemed altogether indifferent<footnote num="60" sym="*"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.9"><MPB ed="Bea" num="70"/><para>Notwithstanding the sanctity of our holy religion, says <sc>Tully</sc><footnote num="61" sym="†"/>, no crime is more common with us than sacrilege: But was it ever heard of, that an <sc>Egyptian</sc> violated the temple of a cat, an ibis, or a crocodile? There is no torture, an <sc>Egyptian</sc> would not undergo, says the same author in another place<footnote num="62" sym="‡"/>, rather than injure an ibis, an aspic, a cat, a dog, or a crocodile. Thus it is strictly true, what <sc>Dryden</sc> observes, <blockquote>“Of whatsoe’er descent their godhead be, <br/>“Stock, stone, or other homely pedigree, <br/>“In his defence his servants are as bold, <br/>“As if he had been born of beaten gold.” <br/><tab/><tab/><tab/><sc>Absolom</sc> and <sc>Achitophel.</sc></blockquote> Nay, the baser the materials are, of which the divinity is composed, the greater devotion is he likely to excite in the breasts of his deluded votaries. They exult in their shame, and make a merit with their deity, in braving, for his sake, all the ridicule and contumely of his ene<OPB num="449"/>mies. Ten thousand Crusaders inlist themselves under the holy banners; and even openly triumph in those parts of their religion, which their adversaries regard as the most reproachful.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.10"><para>There occurs, I own, a difficulty in the <sc>Egyptian</sc> system of theology; as indeed, few systems of that kind are entirely free from difficulties. It is evident, from their method of propagation, that a couple of cats, in fifty years, would stock a whole kingdom; and if that religious veneration were still paid them, it would, in twenty more, not only be easier in <sc>Egypt</sc> to find a god than a man, which <sc>Petronius</sc> says was the case in some parts of <sc>Italy</sc>; but the gods must at last entirely starve the men, and leave themselves neither priests nor votaries remaining. It is probable, therefore, that this wise nation, the most celebrated in antiquity for prudence and sound policy, foreseeing such dangerous consequences, reserved all their worship for the full-grown divinities, and used the freedom to drown the holy spawn or little sucking gods, without any scruple or remorse. And thus the practice of warping the tenets of religion, in order to serve temporal interests, is not, by any means, to be regarded as an invention of these later ages.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.11"><para>The learned, philosophical <sc>Varro</sc>, discoursing of religion, pretends not to deliver any thing beyond probabilities and appearances: Such was his good sense and moderation! But the passionate, the zealous <sc>Augustin</sc>, insults the noble <sc>Roman</sc> on his scepticism and reserve, and professes the most thorough belief and assurance<footnote num="63" sym="*"/>. A heathen poet, however, contemporary <MPB ed="Bea" num="71"/>with the saint, absurdly esteems the religious system of the latter so false, <OPB num="450"/>that even the credulity of children, he says, could not engage them to believe it<footnote num="64" sym="†"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.12"><para>Is it strange, when mistakes are so common, to find every one positive and dogmatical? And that the zeal often rises in proportion to the error? <em>Moverunt,</em> says <sc>Spartian</sc>, <em>&amp; ea tempestate, Jud<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>i bellum quod vetabantur mutilare genitalia<footnote num="65" sym="‡"/>.</em></para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.13"><para>If ever there was a nation or a time, in which the public religion lost all authority over mankind, we might expect, that infidelity in <sc>Rome</sc>, during the <sc>Ciceronian</sc> age, would openly have erected its throne, and that <sc>Cicero</sc> himself, in every speech and action, would have been its most declared abettor. But it appears, that, whatever sceptical liberties that great man might take, in his writings or in philosophical conversation; he yet avoided, in the common conduct of life, the imputation of deism and profaneness. Even in his own family, and to his wife <sc>Terentia</sc>, whom he highly trusted, he was willing to appear a devout religionist; and there remains a letter, addressed to her, in which he seriously desires her to offer sacrifice to <sc>Apollo</sc> and <sc><del>Æ</del><ins comment="originally 'Æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">AE</ins>sculapius</sc>, in gratitude for the recovery of his health<footnote num="66" sym="ǁ"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.14"><para><sc>Pompey</sc>’s devotion was much more sincere: In all his conduct, during the civil wars, he paid a great regard to auguries, dreams, and prophesies<footnote num="67" sym="§"/>. <sc>Augustus</sc> was tainted with superstition of every kind. As it is reported of <sc>Milton</sc>, that his poetical genius never flowed with ease and abundance in the spring; so <sc>Augustus</sc> observed, that his own genius for dreaming never was so perfect during that season, nor was so much to be relied on, as during the rest of the year. That great and able <OPB num="451"/>emperor was also extremely uneasy, when he happened to change his shoes, and put the right foot shoe on the left foot<footnote num="68" sym="*"/>. In short it cannot be doubted, but the votaries of the established superstition of antiquity were as numerous in every state, as those of the modern religion are at present. Its influence was as universal; though it was not so great. As many people gave their assent to it; though that assent was not seemingly so strong, precise, and affirmative.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.15"><para>We may observe, that, notwithstanding the dogmatical, imperious style of all superstition, the conviction of the religionists, in all ages, is more affected than real, and scarcely ever approaches, in any degree, to that solid belief and persuasion, which governs us in the common affairs of life. Men dare not avow, even to their own hearts, the doubts which they entertain on such <MPB ed="Bea" num="72"/>subjects: They make a merit of implicit faith; and disguise to themselves their real infidelity, by the strongest asseverations and most positive bigotry. But nature is too hard for all their endeavours, and suffers not the obscure, glimmering light, afforded in those shadowy regions, to equal the strong impressions, made by common sense and by experience. The usual course of men’s conduct belies their words, and shows, that their assent in these matters is some unaccountable operation of the mind between disbelief and conviction, but approaching much nearer to the former than to the latter.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.16"><para>Since, therefore, the mind of man appears of so loose and unsteady a texture, that, even at present, when so many persons find an interest in continually employing on it the chissel and the hammer, yet are they not able to engrave theological tenets with any lasting impression; <OPB num="452"/>how much more must this have been the case in ancient times, when the retainers to the holy function were so much fewer in comparison? No wonder, that the appearances were then very inconsistent, and that men, on some occasions, might seem determined infidels, and enemies to the established religion, without being so in reality; or at least, without knowing their own minds in that particular.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.17"><para>Another cause, which rendered the ancient religions much looser than the modern, is, that the former were <em>traditional</em> and the latter are <em>scriptural</em>; and the tradition in the former was complex, contradictory, and, on many occasions, doubtful; so that it could not possibly be reduced to any standard and canon, or afford any determinate articles of faith. The stories of the gods were numberless like the popish legends; and though every one, almost, believed a part of these stories, yet no one could believe or know the whole: While, at the same time, all must have acknowledged, that no one part stood on a better foundation than the rest. The traditions of different cities and nations were also, on many occasions, directly opposite; and no reason could be assigned for preferring one to the other. And as there was an infinite number of stories, with regard to which tradition was nowise positive; the gradation was insensible, from the most fundamental articles of faith, to those loose and precarious fictions. The pagan religion, therefore, seemed to vanish like a cloud, whenever one approached to it, and examined it piecemeal. It could never be ascertained by any fixed dogmas and principles. And though this did not convert the generality of mankind from so absurd a faith; for when will the people be reasonable? yet it made them faulter and hesitate more in <OPB num="453"/>maintaining their principles, and was even apt to produce, in certain dispositions of mind, <MPB ed="Bea" num="73"/>some practices and opinions, which had the appearance of determined infidelity.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.18"><para>To which we may add, that the fables of the pagan religion were, of themselves, light, easy, and familiar; without devils, or seas of brimstone, or any object that could much terrify the imagination. Who could forbear smiling, when he thought of the loves of <sc>Mars</sc> and <sc>Venus</sc>, or the amorous frolics of <sc>Jupiter</sc> and <sc>Pan</sc>? In this respect, it was a true poetical religion; if it had not rather too much levity for the graver kinds of poetry. We find that it has been adopted by modern bards; nor have these talked with greater freedom and irreverence of the gods, whom they regarded as fictions, than the ancients did of the real objects of their devotion.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.19"><para>The inference is by no means just, that, because a system of religion has made no deep impression on the minds of a people, it must therefore have been positively rejected by all men of common sense, and that opposite principles, in spite of the prejudices of education, were generally established by argument and reasoning. I know not, but a contrary inference may be more probable. The less importunate and assuming any species of superstition appears, the less will it provoke men’s spleen and indignation, or engage them into enquiries concerning its foundation and origin. This in the mean time is obvious, that the empire of all religious faith over the understanding is wavering and uncertain, subject to every variety of humour, and dependent on the present incidents, which strike the imagination. The difference is only in the degrees. An ancient will place a stroke of impiety and one of superstition alternately, throughout a <OPB num="454"/>whole discourse<footnote num="69" sym="*"/>: A modern often thinks in the same way, though he may be more guarded in his expression.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.20"><para><sc>Lucian</sc> tells us expressly<footnote num="70" sym="†"/> that whoever believed not the most ridiculous fables of paganism was deemed by the people profane and impious. To what purpose, indeed, would that agreeable author have employed the whole force of his wit and satire against the national religion, had not that religion been generally believed by his countrymen and contemporaries?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.21"><para><sc>Livy</sc><footnote num="71" sym="‡"/> acknowledges as frankly, as any divine would at present, the common incredulity of his age; but then he condemns it as severely. <MPB ed="Bea" num="74"/>And who can imagine, that a national superstition, which could delude so ingenious a man, would not also impose on the generality of the people?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.22"><para>The <sc>Stoics</sc> bestowed many magnificent and even impious epithets on their sage; that he alone was rich, free, a king, and equal to the immortal gods. They forgot to add, that he was not inferior in prudence and understanding to an old woman. For surely nothing can be more pitiful than the sentiments, which that sect entertained with regard to religious matters; while they seriously agree with the common augurs, that, when a raven <OPB num="455"/>croaks from the left, it is a good omen; but a bad one, when a rook makes a noise from the same quarter. <sc>Pan<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>tius</sc> was the only <sc>Stoic</sc>, among the <sc>Greeks</sc>, who so much as doubted with regard to auguries and divinations<footnote num="72" sym="*"/>. <sc>Marcus Antoninus</sc><footnote num="73" sym="†"/> tells us, that he himself had received many admonitions from the gods in his sleep. It is true, <sc>Epictetus</sc><footnote num="74" sym="‡"/> forbids us to regard the language of rooks and ravens; but it is not, that they do not speak truth: It is only, because they can foretel nothing but the breaking of our neck or the forfeiture of our estate; which are circumstances, says he, that nowise concern us. Thus the <sc>Stoics</sc> join a philosophical enthusiasm to a religious superstition. The force of their mind, being all turned to the side of morals, unbent itself in that of religion<footnote num="75" sym="ǁ"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.23"><para><sc>Plato</sc><footnote num="76" sym="§"/> introduces <sc>Socrates</sc> affirming, that the accusation of impiety raised against him was owing entirely to his rejecting such fables, as those of <sc>Saturn</sc>’s castrating his father <sc>Uranus</sc>, and <sc>Jupiter</sc>’s dethroning <sc>Saturn</sc>: Yet in a subsequent dialogue<footnote num="77" sym="†"/>, <sc>Socrates</sc> confesses, that the doctrine of the mortality of the soul was the received opinion of the people. Is there here any contradiction? Yes, surely: But the contradiction is not in <sc>Plato</sc>; it is in the people, whose religious principles in general are always composed of the most discordant parts; especially in an age, when superstition sate so easy and light upon them<footnote num="78" sym="††"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.24"><OPB num="456"/><MPB ed="Bea" num="75"/><para>The same <sc>Cicero</sc>, who affected, in his own family, to appear a devout religionist, makes no scruple, in a public court of judicature, of treating the doctrine of a future state as a ridiculous fable, to which no body could give any attention<footnote num="79" sym="*"/>. <sc>Sallust</sc><footnote num="80" sym="†"/> represents <sc>C<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>sar</sc> as speaking the same language in the open senate<footnote num="81" sym="‡"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.25"><para>But that all these freedoms implied not a total and universal infidelity and scepticism amongst the people, is too apparent to be denied. Though some parts of the national religion hung loose upon the minds of men, other parts adhered more closely to them: And it was the chief business of the sceptical philosophers to show, that there was no more foundation for one than for the other. This is the artifice of <sc>Cotta</sc> in the dialogues concerning the <em>nature of the gods</em>. He refutes the whole system of mythology by leading the orthodox gradually, from the more momentous stories, which were believed, to the more frivolous, which every one ridiculed: From the gods to the goddesses; from the goddesses to the nymphs; from the nymphs to the fawns and satyrs. His master, <sc>Carneades</sc>, had employed the same method of reasoning<footnote num="82" sym="ǁ"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 12.26"><para>Upon the whole, the greatest and most observable differences between a <em>traditional, mythological</em> religion, and a <em>systematical, scholastic</em> one, are two: <MPB ed="Bea" num="76"/>The former is often <OPB num="457"/>more reasonable, as consisting only of a multitude of stories, which, however groundless, imply no express absurdity and demonstrative contradiction; and sits also so easy and light on men’s mind, that, though it may be as universally received, it happily makes no such deep impression on the affections and understanding.</para></dhot>
