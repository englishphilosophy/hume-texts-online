<dhot id="N 4.1"><para>The only point of theology, in which we shall find a consent of mankind almost universal, is, that there is invisible, intelligent power in the world: But whether this power be supreme or subordinate, whether confined to one being, or distributed among several, what attributes, qualities, connexions, or principles of action ought to be ascribed to those beings; concerning all these points, there is the widest difference in the popular systems of theology. Our ancestors in <sc>Europe</sc>, before the revival of letters, believed, as we do at present, that there was one supreme God, the author of nature, whose power, though in itself uncontroulable, was yet often exerted by the interposition of his angels and subordinate ministers, who executed his sacred purposes. But they also believed, that all nature was full of other invisible powers; fairies, goblins, elves, sprights; beings, stronger and mightier than men, but much inferior to the celestial natures, who surround the throne of God. Now, suppose, that any one, in those ages, had denied the existence of God and of his angels; would not his impiety justly have deserved the appellation of atheism, even though he had still allowed, by some odd capricious reasoning, that the popular stories of elves and fairies were just and well-grounded? The difference, on the one hand, between such a person and a genuine theist is infi<OPB num="416"/>nitely greater than that, on the other, between him and one that absolutely excludes all invisible intelligent power. And it is a fallacy, merely from the casual resemblance of names, without any conformity of meaning, to rank such opposite opinions under the same denomination.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 4.2"><para>To any one, who considers justly of the matter, it will appear, that the gods of all polytheists are no better than the elves or fairies of our ancestors, and merit as little any pious worship or veneration. These pretended religionists are really a kind of superstitious atheists, and acknowledge no being, that corresponds to our idea of a deity. No first principle of mind or thought: No supreme government and administration: No divine contrivance or intention in the fabric of the world.</para></dhot>

The <sc>Caunii</sc>, a nation in the Lesser <sc>Asia</sc>, resolving to admit no strange gods among them, regularly, at certain seasons, assembled themselves compleatly armed, beat the air with their lances, and proceeded in that manner to their frontiers; in order, as they said, to expel the foreign deities<footnote num="9" sym="ǁ"/>. <em>Not even the immortal gods,</em> said some <sc>German</sc> nations to <sc>C<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>sar</sc>, <em>are a match for the <sc>Suevi</sc><footnote num="10" sym="§"/>.</em></para></dhot>

<dhot id="N 4.5"><para>Some writers<footnote num="13" sym="‡"/> have been surprized, that the impieties of <sc>Aristophanes</sc> should have been tolerated, nay publicly acted and applauded by the <sc>Athenians</sc>; a people so superstitious and so jealous of the public religion, that, at that very time, they put <sc>Socrates</sc> to death for his imagined incredulity. But these writers do not consider, that the ludicrous, familiar images, under which the gods are represented by that comic poet, instead of appearing impious, were the genuine lights in which the ancients conceived their divinities. What conduct can be more criminal or mean, than that of <sc>Jupiter</sc> in the <sc>Amphitrion</sc>? Yet that play, which represented his gallante exploits, was supposed so agreeable to him, that it was always acted in <sc>Rome</sc> by public authority, when the state was threatened with pestilence, famine, or any general calamity<footnote num="14" sym="ǁ"/>.

We may gather from <sc>Seneca</sc><footnote num="16" sym="*"/>, that it was usual, for the votaries in the temples, to make interest with the beadle or sexton, that they might have a seat near the image of the deity, in order to be the best heard in their prayers and applications to him.

The ancient mythologists, indeed, seem throughout to have rather embraced the idea of generation than that of crea<OPB num="419"/>tion or formation; and to have thence accounted for the origin of this universe.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="N 4.9"><para><sc>Diodorus Siculus</sc><footnote num="24" sym="†"/>, beginning his work with an enumeration of the most reasonable opinions concerning the origin of the world, makes no mention of a deity or intelligent mind; though it is evident from his history, that he was much more prone to superstition than to irreligion. <MPB ed="Bea" num="47"/>And in another passage<footnote num="25" sym="‡"/>, talking of the <sc>Ichthyophagi</sc>, a nation in <sc>India</sc>, he says, that, there being so great difficulty in accounting for their descent, we must conclude them to be <em>aborigines</em>, without any beginning of their generation, propagating their race from all eternity; as some of the physiologers, in treating of the origin of nature, have justly observed. “But in such subjects as these,” adds the historian, “which exceed all human capacity, it may well happen, that those, who discourse the most, know the least; reaching a specious appearance of truth in their reasonings, while extremely wide of the real truth and matter of fact.”</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 4.10"><OPB num="420"/><para>A strange sentiment in our eyes, to be embraced by a professed and zealous religionist<footnote num="26" sym="*"/>! But it was merely by accident, that the question concerning the origin of the world did ever in ancient times enter into religious systems, or was treated of by theologers. The philosophers alone made profession of delivering systems of this kind; and it was pretty late too before these bethought themselves of having recourse to a mind or supreme intelligence, as the first cause of all. So far was it from being esteemed profane in those days to account for the origin of things without a deity, that <sc>Thales</sc>, <sc>Anaximenes</sc>, <sc>Heraclitus</sc>, and others, who embraced that system of cosmogony, past unquestioned; while <sc>Anaxagoras</sc>, the first undoubted theist among the philosophers, was perhaps the first that ever was accused of atheism<footnote num="27" sym="†"/>.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="N 4.12"><OPB num="421"/><para>The common people were never likely to push their researches so far, or derive from reasoning their systems of religion; when philologers and mythologists, we see, scarcely ever discovered so much penetration. And even the philosophers, who discoursed of such topics, readily assented to the grossest theory, and admitted the joint origin of gods and men from night and chaos; from fire, water, air, or whatever they established to be the ruling element.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 4.13"><para>Nor was it only on their first origin, that the gods were supposed dependent on the powers of nature. Throughout the whole period of their existence they were subjected to the dominion of fate or destiny. <em>Think of the force of necessity,</em> says <sc>Agrippa</sc> to the <sc>Roman</sc> people, <em>that force, to which even the gods must submit<footnote num="29" sym="*"/>.</em> And the Younger <sc>Pliny</sc><footnote num="30" sym="†"/>, agreeably to this way of thinking, tells us, that amidst the darkness, horror, and confusion, which ensued upon the first eruption of <sc>Vesuvius</sc>, several concluded, that all nature was going to wrack, and that gods and men were perishing in one common ruin.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 4.14"><para>It is great complaisance, indeed, if we dignify with the name of religion such an imperfect system of theology, and put it on a level with later systems, which are founded on principles more just and more sublime. For my part, I can scarcely allow the principles even of <sc>Marcus Aurelius</sc>, <sc>Plutarch</sc>, and some other <em>Stoics</em> and <em>Academics</em>, though much more refined than the pagan superstition, to be worthy of the honourable appellation of theism. For if the mythology of the heathens resemble the ancient <sc>European</sc> system of spiritual beings, excluding God and angels, and leaving only fairies and <OPB num="422"/>sprights; the creed of these philosophers may justly be said to exclude a deity, and to leave only angels and fairies.</para></dhot>
