<dhot id="N 5.1"><para>But it is chiefly our present business to consider the gross polytheism of the vulgar, and to trace all its various appearances, in the principles of human nature, whence they are derived.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 5.2"><para>Whoever learns by argument, the existence of invisible intelligent power, must reason from the admirable contrivance of natural objects, and must suppose the world to be the workmanship of that divine being, the original cause of all things. But the vulgar polytheist, so far from admitting that idea, deifies every part of the universe, and conceives all the conspicuous productions of nature, to be themselves so many real divinities. The sun, moon, and stars, are all gods according to his system: Fountains are inhabited by nymphs, and trees by hamadryads: Even monkies, dogs, cats, and other animals often become sacred in his eyes, and strike him with a religious veneration. And thus, however strong men’s propensity to believe invisible, intelligent power in nature, their propensity is equally strong to rest their attention on sensible, visible objects; and in order to reconcile these opposite inclinations, they are led to unite the invisible power with some visible object.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 5.3"><para>The distribution also of distinct provinces to the several deities is apt to cause some allegory, both physical and moral, to enter into the vulgar systems of polytheism. The god of war will naturally be represented as furious, cruel, and impetuous: The god of poetry as elegant, <OPB num="423"/>polite, and amiable: The god of merchandise, especially in early times, as thievish and deceitful. The allegories, supposed in <sc>Homer</sc> and other mythologists, I allow, have often been so strained, that men of sense are apt entirely to reject them, and to consider them as the production merely of the fancy and conceit of critics and commentators. But that allegory really has place in the heathen mythology is undeniable even on the least reflection. <sc>Cupid</sc> the son of <sc>Venus</sc>; the Muses the daughters of Memory; <sc>Prometheus</sc>, the wise brother, and <sc>Epimetheus</sc> the foolish; <sc>Hygieia</sc> or the goddess of health descended from <sc><del>Æ</del><ins comment="originally 'Æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">AE</ins>sculapius</sc> or the god of physic: Who sees not, in these, and in many other instances, the plain traces of allegory? When a god is supposed to preside over any passion, event, or system of actions, it is almost <MPB ed="Bea" num="50"/>unavoidable to give him a genealogy, attributes, and adventures, suitable to his supposed powers and influence; and to carry on that similitude and comparison, which is naturally so agreeable to the mind of man.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 5.4"><para>Allegories, indeed, entirely perfect, we ought not to expect as the productions of ignorance and superstition; there being no work of genius that requires a nicer hand, or has been more rarely executed with success. That <em>Fear</em> and <em>Terror</em> are the sons of <sc>Mars</sc> is just; but why by <sc>Venus</sc><footnote num="31" sym="*"/>? That <em>Harmony</em> is the daughter of <sc>Venus</sc> is regular; but why by <sc>Mars</sc><footnote num="32" sym="†"/>? That <em>Sleep</em> is the brother of <em>Death</em> is suitable; but why describe him as enamoured of one of the Graces<footnote num="33" sym="‡"/>? And since the ancient mythologists fall into mistakes so gross and palpable, we have no reason surely to expect such refined and long-<OPB num="424"/>spun allegories, as some have endeavoured to deduce from their fictions.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 5.5"><para><sc>Lucretius</sc> was plainly seduced by the strong appearance of allegory, which is observable in the pagan fictions. He first addresses himself to <sc>Venus</sc> as to that generating power, which animates, renews, and beautifies the universe: But is soon betrayed by the mythology into incoherencies, while he prays to that allegorical personage to appease the furies of her lover <sc>Mars</sc>: An idea not drawn from allegory, but from the popular religion, and which <sc>Lucretius</sc>, as an <sc>Epicurean</sc>, could not consistently admit of.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 5.6"><para>The deities of the vulgar are so little superior to human creatures, that, where men are affected with strong sentiments of veneration or gratitude for any hero or public benefactor, nothing can be more natural than to convert him into a god, and fill the heavens, after this manner, with continual recruits from among mankind. Most of the divinities of the ancient world are supposed to have once been men, and to have been beholden for their <em>apotheosis</em> to the admiration and affection of the people. The real history of their adventures, corrupted by tradition, and elevated by the marvellous, become a plentiful source of fable; especially in passing through the hands of poets, allegorists, and priests, who successively improved upon the wonder and astonishment of the ignorant multitude.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 5.7"><para>Painters too and sculptors came in for their share of profit in the sacred mysteries; and furnishing men with sensible representations of their divinities, whom they cloathed in human figures, gave great encrease to the public devotion, and determined its object. It was probably for want of these arts in rude and barbarous ages, that men deified plants, animals, and even brute, unor<OPB num="425"/>ganized matter; and rather than be without a sensible object of worship, affixed divinity to such ungainly forms. <MPB ed="Bea" num="51"/>Could any statuary of <sc>Syria</sc>, in early times, have formed a just figure of <sc>Apollo</sc>, the conic stone, <sc>Heliogabalus</sc>, had never become the object of such profound adoration, and been received as a representation of the solar deity<footnote num="34" sym="*"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 5.8"><para><sc>Stilpo</sc> was banished by the council of <sc>Areopagus</sc>, for affirming that the <sc>Minerva</sc> in the citadel was no divinity; but the workmanship of <sc>Phidias</sc>, the sculptor<footnote num="35" sym="†"/>. What degree of reason must we expect in the religious belief of the vulgar in other nations; when <sc>Athenians</sc> and <sc>Areopagites</sc> could entertain such gross conceptions?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 5.9"><para>These then are the general principles of polytheism, founded in human nature, and little or nothing dependent on caprice and accident. As the <em>causes</em>, which bestow happiness or misery, are, in general, very little known and very uncertain, our anxious concern endeavours to attain a determinate idea of them; and finds no better expedient than to represent them as intelligent voluntary agents, like ourselves; only somewhat superior in power and wisdom. The limited influence of these agents, and their great proximity to human weakness, introduce the various distribution and division of their authority; and thereby give rise to allegory. The same principles naturally deify mortals, superior in power, courage, or understanding, and produce hero-worship; together with fabulous history and mythological tradition, <OPB num="426"/>in all its wild and unaccountable forms. And as an invisible spiritual intelligence is an object too refined for vulgar apprehension, men naturally affix it to some sensible representation; such as either the more conspicuous parts of nature, or the statues, images, and pictures, which a more refined age forms of its divinities.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 5.10"><para>Almost all idolaters, of whatever age or country, concur in these general principles and conceptions; and even the particular characters and provinces, which they assign to their deities, are not extremely different<footnote num="36" sym="*"/>. The <sc>Greek</sc> and <sc>Roman</sc> travellers and conquerors, without much difficulty, found their own deities every where; and said, This is <sc>Mercury</sc>, that <sc>Venus</sc>; this <sc>Mars</sc>, that <sc>Neptune</sc>; by whatever title the strange gods might be denominated. The goddess <sc>Hertha</sc> of our <sc>Saxon</sc> ancestors seems to be no other, according to <sc>Tacitus</sc><footnote num="37" sym="†"/>, than the <em>Mater Tellus</em> of the <sc>Romans</sc>; and his conjecture was evidently just.</para></dhot>
