<dhot id="IS 3"><para><sc>But</sc> just metaphysics teach us, that the notion of substance is wholly confused and imperfect, and that we have no other idea of any substance than as an aggregate of particular qualities, inhering in an unknown something. Mat<OPB ed="five dissertations" num="226"/>ter, therefore, and spirit are at bottom equally unknown; and we cannot determine what qualities <ins comment="written insertion in Hume's hand">may</ins> inhere in the one or in the other.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IS 4"><para><sc>They</sc> likewise teach us, that nothing can be decided <em>a priori</em> concerning any cause or effect; and that experience being the only source of our judgments of this nature, we cannot know from any other principle, whether matter, by its structure or arrangement, may not be the cause of thought. Abstract reasonings cannot decide any question of fact or existence.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IS 5"><para><sc>But</sc> admitting a spiritual substance to be dispersed throughout the universe, like the etherial fire of the <em>Stoics</em>, and to be the only inherent subject of thought; we have reason to conclude from <em>analogy</em>, that nature uses <OPB num="27"/>it after the same manner she does the other substance, matter. She employs it as a kind of paste or clay; modifies it into a variety of forms and existences; dissolves after a time each modification; and from its substance erects a new form. As the same material substance may successively compose the body of all animals, the same spiritual substance may compose their minds: Their consciousness, or that system of thought, which <OPB ed="five dissertations" num="227"/>they formed <MPB ed="Mil" num="592"/>during life, may be continually dissolved by death; and nothing interest them in the new modification. The most positive asserters of the mortality of the soul, never denied the immortality of its substance. And that an immaterial substance, as well as a material, may lose its memory or consciousness appears, in part, from experience, if the soul be immaterial.</para></dhot>
