<dhot id="PA 1"><para><ac><dc>T</dc>here</ac> is very little ground, either from reason or observation, to conclude the world eternal or incorruptible. The continual and rapid motion of matter, the violent revolutions with which every part is agitated, the changes remarked in the heavens, the plain traces as well as tradition of an universal deluge, or general convulsion of the elements; all these prove strongly the mortality of this fabric of the world, and its passage, by corruption or dissolution, from one state or order to another. It must therefore, as well as each individual form which it contains, have its infancy, youth, manhood, and old age; and it is probable, that, in all these variations, man, equally with every animal and vegetable, will partake. In the flourishing age of the world, it may be expected, that the <MPB ed="Mil" num="378"/>human species should possess greater vigour both of mind and body, more prosperous health, higher spirits, longer life, and a stronger inclination and power of generation. But if the general system of things, and human society of course, have any such gradual revolutions, they are too slow to be discernible in that short period which is comprehended by history and tradition. Stature and force of body, length of life, even courage and extent of genius, seem hitherto to have <OPB num="398"/>been naturally, in all ages, pretty much the same. The arts and sciences, indeed, have flourished in one period, and have decayed in another: But we may observe, that, at the time when they rose to greatest perfection among one people, they were perhaps totally unknown to all the neighbouring nations; and though they universally decayed in one age, yet in a succeeding generation they again revived, and diffused themselves over the world. As far, therefore, as observation reaches, there is no universal difference discernible in the human species; and though it were allowed, that the universe, like an animal body, had a natural progress from infancy to old age; yet as it must still be uncertain, whether, at present, it be advancing to its point of perfection, or declining from it, we cannot thence presuppose any decay in human nature<footnote num="1" sym="*"/>. To prove, therefore, or account for that superior populousness of antiquity, which is commonly supposed, by the imaginary youth or vigour of the world, will scarcely be admitted by any just reasoner. These <em>general physical</em> causes ought entirely to be excluded from this question.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 2"><MPB ed="Mil" num="379"/><para>There are indeed some more <em>particular physical</em> causes of importance. Diseases are mentioned in antiquity, which are almost unknown to modern medicine; and new diseases have arisen and propagated themselves, of which there are no traces in ancient history. In this particular we may observe, upon comparison, that the disadvantage is much on the side of the moderns. Not to mention some others of less moment; the small-pox <del>commit</del><ins comment="originally 'commit'; 'commits' in earlier editions, which is clearly what was intended">commits</ins> such ravages, as would almost alone account for the great superiority ascribed to ancient times. The tenth or the twelfth part of mankind, destroyed every gener<MPB ed="Mil" num="380"/>ation, should make a vast difference, it may be thought, <OPB num="399"/>in the numbers of the people; and when joined to venereal distempers, a new plague diffused every where, this disease is perhaps equivalent, by its constant operation, to the three great scourges of mankind, war, pestilence, and famine. Were it certain, therefore, that ancient times were more populous than the present, and could no moral causes be assigned for so great a change; these physical causes alone, in the opinion of many, would be sufficient to give us satisfaction on that head.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 3"><para>But is it certain, that antiquity was so much more populous, as is pretended? The extravagancies of <sc>Vossius</sc>, with regard to this subject, are well known. But an author of much greater genius and discernment has ventured to affirm, that, according to the best computations which these subjects will admit of, there are not now, on the face of the earth, the fiftieth part of mankind, which existed in the time of <sc>Julius C<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>sar</sc><footnote num="2" sym="†"/>. It may easily be observed, that the comparison, in this case, must be imperfect, even though we confine our<MPB ed="Mil" num="381"/>selves to the scene of ancient history; <sc>Europe</sc>, and the nations round the <sc>Mediterranean</sc>. We know not exactly the numbers of any <sc>European</sc> kingdom, or even city, at present: How can we pretend to calculate those of ancient cities and states, where historians have left us such imperfect traces? For my part, the matter appears to me so uncertain, that, as I intend to throw together some reflections on that head, I shall intermingle the enquiry concerning <em>causes</em> with that concerning <em>facts;</em> which ought never to be admitted, where the facts can be ascertained with any tolerable assurance. We shall, <em>first</em>, consider whether it be probable, from what we know of the situation of society in both periods, <OPB num="400"/>that antiquity must have been more populous; <em>secondly</em>, whether in reality it was so. If I can make it appear, that the conclusion is not so certain as is pretended, in favour of antiquity, it is all I aspire to.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 4"><para>In general, we may observe, that the question, with regard to the comparative populousness of ages or kingdoms, implies important consequences, and commonly determines concerning the preference of their whole police, their manners, and the constitution of their government. For as there is in all men, both male and female, a desire and power of generation, more active than is ever universally exerted, the restraints, which they lie under, must proceed from some difficulties in their situation, which it belongs to a wise legislature carefully to observe and remove. Almost every man who thinks he can maintain a family will have one; and the human species, at this rate of propagation, would more than double every generation. How fast do mankind multiply in every colony or new settlement; where it is an easy matter to provide for a family; and where men are nowise straitened or confined, as in long established governments? History tells us frequently of plagues, which have swept away the third or fourth part of a people: Yet in a generation or two, the destruction was not perceived; and the society had again acquired their former number. The lands which were cultivated, the houses built, the commodities raised, the riches acquired, enabled the people, who escaped, immediately to marry, and to rear families, <MPB ed="Mil" num="382"/>which supplied the place of those who had perished<footnote num="3" sym="†"/>. And for a like reason, every wise, just, and mild government, by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure, will always abound most in people, as well as in commodities and riches. A country, indeed, whose climate and soil are fitted for vines, will naturally be more populous than one which produces corn only, and that more populous than one which is only fitted for pasturage. In general, warm climates, as the necessities of the inhabitants are there fewer, and vegetation more powerful, are likely to be most populous: But if every thing else be equal, it seems natural to expect, that, wherever there are most happiness and virtue, and the wisest institutions, there will also be most people.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 5"><MPB ed="Mil" num="383"/><para>The question, therefore, concerning the populousness of ancient and modern times, being allowed of great importance, it will be requisite, if we would bring it to some determination, to compare both the <em>domestic</em> and <em>political</em> situation of these two periods, in order to judge of the facts by their moral causes; which is the <em>first</em> view in which we proposed to consider them.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 6"><para>The chief difference between the <em>domestic</em> <del>œ</del><ins comment="originally 'œ'; separated to make searching the text easier">oe</ins>conomy of the ancients and that of the moderns consists in the practice of slavery, which prevailed among the former, and which has been abolished for some centuries throughout the greater part of <sc>Europe</sc>. Some passionate admirers of the ancients, and zealous partizans of civil liberty, (for these sentiments, as they are, both of them, in the main, extremely just, are found to be almost inseparable) cannot forbear regretting the loss of this institution; and whilst they brand all submission to the government of a single person with the harsh denomination of slavery, they would gladly reduce the greater part of mankind to real slavery and subjection. But to one who considers coolly on the subject it will appear, that human <OPB num="402"/>nature, in general, really enjoys more liberty at present, in the most arbitrary government of <sc>Europe</sc>, than it ever did during the most flourishing period of ancient times. As much as submission to a petty prince, whose dominions extend not beyond a single city, is more grievous than obedience to a great monarch; so much is domestic slavery more cruel and oppressive than any civil subjection whatsoever. The more the master is removed from us in place and rank, the greater liberty we enjoy; the less are our actions inspected and controled; and the fainter that cruel comparison becomes between our own subjection, and the freedom, and even dominion of another. The remains which are found of domestic slavery, in the <sc>American</sc> colonies, and among some <sc>European</sc> nations, would never surely create a desire of rendering it more universal. The little humanity, commonly observed in persons, accustomed, from their infancy, to exercise so great authority over their fellow-creatures, and to trample upon human nature, were sufficient <MPB ed="Mil" num="384"/>alone to disgust us with that unbounded dominion. Nor can a more probable reason be assigned for the severe, I might say, barbarous manners of ancient times, than the practice of domestic slavery; by which every man of rank was rendered a petty tyrant, and educated amidst the flattery, submission, and low debasement of his slaves.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 7"><para>According to ancient practice, all checks were on the inferior, to restrain him to the duty of submission; none on the superior, to engage him to the reciprocal duties of gentleness and humanity. In modern times, a bad servant finds not easily a good master, nor a bad master a good servant; and the checks are mutual, suitably to the inviolable and eternal laws of reason and equity.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 8"><OPN num="403"/><para>The custom of exposing old, useless, or sick slaves in an island of the <sc>Tyber</sc>, there to starve, seems to have been pretty common in <sc>Rome</sc>; and whoever recovered, after having been so exposed, had his liberty given him, by an edict of the emperor <sc>Claudius</sc>; in which it was likewise forbidden to kill any slave merely for old age or sickness<footnote num="4" sym="*"/>. But supposing that this edict was strictly obeyed, would it better the domestic treatment of slaves, or render their lives much more comfortable? We may imagine what others would practise, when it was the professed maxim of the elder <sc>Cato</sc>, to sell his superannuated slaves for any price, rather than maintain what he esteemed a useless burden<footnote num="5" sym="†"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 9"><para>The <em>ergastula</em>, or dungeons, where slaves in chains were <MPB ed="Mil" num="385"/>forced to work, were very common all over <sc>Italy</sc>. <sc>Columella</sc><footnote num="6" sym="‡"/> advises, that they be always built under ground; and recommends<footnote num="7" sym="ǁ"/> it as the duty of a careful overseer, to call over every day the names of these slaves, like the mustering of a regiment or ship’s company, in order to know presently when any of them had deserted. A proof of the frequency of these <em>ergastula</em>, and of the great number of slaves usually confined in them.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="PA 11"><para>Nothing so common in all trials, even of civil causes, as to call for the evidence of slaves; which was always <OPB num="404"/>extorted by the most exquisite torments. <sc>Demosthenes</sc> says<footnote num="10" sym="*"/>, that, where it was possible to produce, for the same fact, either freemen or slaves, as witnesses, the judges always preferred the torturing of slaves, as a more certain evidence<footnote num="11" sym="†"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 12"><para><sc>Seneca</sc> draws a picture of that disorderly luxury, which changes day into night, and night into day, and inverts every stated hour of every office in life. Among other circumstances, <MPB ed="Mil" num="386"/>such as displacing the meals and times of bathing, he mentions, that, regularly about the third hour of the night, the neighbours of one, who indulges this false refinement, hear the noise of whips and lashes; and, upon enquiry, find that he is then taking an account of the conduct of his servants, and giving them due correction and discipline. This is not remarked as an instance of cruelty, but only of disorder, which, even in actions the most usual and methodical, changes the fixed hours that an established custom had assigned for them<footnote num="12" sym="‡"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 13"><para>But our present business is only to consider the influence of slavery on the populousness of a state. It is pretended, that, in this particular, the ancient practice had infinitely the advantage, and was the chief cause of that extreme populousness, which is supposed in those times. At present, all masters discourage the marrying of their male servants, and admit not by any means the marriage of the female, who are then supposed altogether incapacitated for their service. But where the property <OPB num="405"/>of the servants is lodged in the master, their marriage forms his riches, and brings him a succession of slaves that supply the place of those whom age and infirmity have disabled. He encourages, therefore, their propagation as much as that of his cattle; rears the young with the same care; and <MPB ed="Mil" num="387"/>educates them to some art or calling, which may render them more useful or valuable to him. The opulent are, by this policy, interested in the being at least, though not in the well-being of the poor; and enrich themselves, by encreasing the number and industry of those who are subjected to them. Each man, being a sovereign in his own family, has the same interest with regard to it, as the prince with regard to the state; and has not, like the prince, any opposite motives of ambition or vain-glory, which may lead him to depopulate his little sovereignty. All of it is, at all times, under his eye; and he has leisure to inspect the most minute detail of the marriage and education of his subjects<footnote num="13" sym="*"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 14"><para>Such are the consequences of domestic slavery, according to the first aspect and appearance of things: But if we enter more deeply into the subject, we shall perhaps find reason to retract our hasty determinations. The comparison is shocking between the management of human creatures and that of cattle; but being extremely just, when applied to the present subject, it may be proper to trace the consequences of it. At the capital, near all great cities, in all populous, rich, industrious provinces, few cattle are bred. Provisions, lodging, attendance, labour are there dear; and men find their <OPB num="406"/>account better in buying the cattle, after they come to a certain age, from the remoter and cheaper countries. These are consequently the only breeding countries for cattle; and by a parity of reason, for men too, when the latter are put on the same footing with the former. To rear a child in <sc>London</sc>, till he could be serviceable, would cost much dearer, than to buy one of the same age from <sc>Scotland</sc> or <sc>Ireland</sc>; where he had been bred in a cottage, covered with rags, and fed on oatmeal or potatoes. Those who had slaves, therefore, in all the richer and <MPB ed="Mil" num="388"/>more populous countries, would discourage the pregnancy of the females, and either prevent or destroy the birth. The human species would perish in those places where it ought to encrease the fastest; and a perpetual recruit be wanted from the poorer and more desert provinces. Such a continued drain would tend mightily to depopulate the state, and render great cities ten times more destructive than with us; where every man is master of himself, and provides for his children from the powerful instinct of nature, not the calculations of sordid interest. If <sc>London</sc>, at present, without much encreasing, needs a yearly recruit from the country, of 5000 people, as is usually computed, what must it require, if the greater part of the tradesmen and common people were slaves, and were hindered from breeding by their avaricious masters?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 15"><para>All ancient authors tell us, that there was a perpetual flux of slaves to <sc>Italy</sc> from the remoter provinces, particularly <sc>Syria</sc>, <sc>Cilicia</sc><footnote num="14" sym="*"/>, <sc>Cappadocia</sc>, and the Lesser <sc>Asia</sc>, <sc>Thrace</sc>, and <sc><del>Æ</del><ins comment="originally 'Æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">AE</ins>gypt</sc>: Yet the number of people did not encrease in <sc>Italy</sc>; and writers complain of the continual decay of industry and agricul<OPB num="407"/>ture<footnote num="15" sym="†"/>. Where then is that extreme fertility of the <sc>Roman</sc> slaves, which is commonly supposed? So far from multiplying, they could not, it seems, so much as keep up the stock, without immense recruits.

The <sc>Athenians</sc>, says <sc>Strabo</sc><footnote num="21" sym="†"/>, gave to their slaves, either the names of the nations whence they were bought, as <sc>Lydus</sc>, <sc>Syrus</sc>; or the names that were most common among those nations, as <sc>Manes</sc> or <sc>Midas</sc> to a <sc>Phrygian</sc>, <sc>Tibias</sc> to a <sc>Paphlagonian</sc>.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="PA 21"><para>Consider this passage of <sc>Plutarch</sc><footnote num="28" sym="‡"/>, speaking of the Elder <sc>Cato</sc>. “He had a great number of slaves, whom he took care to buy at the sales of prisoners of war; and he chose them young, that they might easily be accustomed to any diet or manner of life, and be instructed in any business or labour, as men teach any thing to young dogs or horses. —And esteeming love the chief source of all disorders, he allowed the male slaves to have a commerce with the female in his family, <MPB ed="Mil" num="392"/>upon paying a certain sum for this privilege: But he strictly prohibited all intrigues out of his family.” Are there any symptoms in this narration of that care which is supposed in the ancients, of the marriage and propagation of their slaves? If that was a common practice, founded on general interest, it would surely have been embraced by <sc>Cato</sc>, who was a great <del>œ</del><ins comment="originally 'œ'; separated to make searching the text easier">oe</ins>conomist, and lived in times when the ancient frugality and simplicity of manners were still in credit and reputation.</para></dhot>

It is computed, that every ninth child born at <sc>Paris</sc>, is sent to the hospital; though it seems certain, according to the common course of human affairs, that it is not a hundredth child whose parents are altogether incapacitated to rear and educate him. The great difference, for health, industry, and morals, between an education in an hospital and that in a private family, should induce us not to make the entrance into the former too easy and engaging.

Enormous cities are, besides, destructive to society, beget vice and disorder of all kinds, starve the remoter provinces, and even starve themselves, by the prices to which they raise all provisions.

Even where any body of the troops was kept off by hedges, hillocks, woods, or hollow ways, the battle was not so soon decided between the contending parties, but that the others had time to overcome the difficulties which opposed them, and take part in the engagement. And as the whole army was thus engaged, and each man closely buckled to his antagonist, the battles were commonly very bloody, and great slaughter was made on both sides, especially on the vanquished. The long thin lines, required by fire-arms, and the quick decision of the fray, render our modern engagements but partial rencounters, and enable the general, who is foiled in the beginning of the day, to draw off the greater part of his army, sound and entire.</para></dhot>

And a herd frequently consists of a thousand or more swine. When one of these herds in feeding meets with another, they mix together; and the swine-herds have no other expedient for separating them than to go to different quarters, where they sound their horn; and these animals, being accustomed to that signal, run immediately each to the horn of his own keeper.

Whether the grandeur of a city be founded on commerce or on empire, there seem to be invincible obstacles, which prevent its farther progress. The seats of vast monarchies, by introducing extravagant luxury, irregular expence, idleness, dependence, and false ideas of rank and superiority, are improper for commerce. Extensive commerce checks itself, by raising the price of all labour and commodities. When a great court engages the attendance of a numerous nobility, possessed of overgrown fortunes, the middling gentry remain in their provincial towns, where they can make a figure on a moderate income. And if the dominions of a state arrive at an enormous size, there necessarily arise many capitals, in the remoter provinces, whither all the inhabitants, except a few courtiers, repair for education, fortune, and amusement<footnote num="216" sym="*"/>. <sc>London</sc>, by uniting extensive commerce and middling empire, has, perhaps, arrived at a greatness, which no city will ever be able to exceed.</para></dhot>

Many passages of <sc>Horace</sc> suppose the streets of <sc>Rome</sc> full of snow and ice. We should have more certainty with regard to this point, had the ancients known the use of thermometers: But their writers, without intending it, give us information, sufficient to convince us, that the winters are now much more temperate at <sc>Rome</sc> than formerly. At present the <sc>Tyber</sc> no more freezes at <sc>Rome</sc> than the <sc>Nile</sc> at <sc>Cairo</sc>.

Such a change, if real, will be allowed an evident sign of the better cultivation and peopling of countries before the age of <sc>Saserna</sc><footnote num="228" sym="ǁ"/>; and if it be continued to the present times, is a <MPB ed="Mil" num="452"/>proof, that these advantages have been continually encreasing throughout this part of the world.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 165"><para>Let us now cast our eye over all the countries which are the scene of ancient and modern history, and compare their past and present situation: We shall not, perhaps, find such foundation for the complaint of the present emptiness and desolation of the world. <sc><del>Æ</del><ins comment="originally 'Æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">AE</ins>gypt</sc> is represented by <sc>Maillet</sc>, to whom we owe the best account of it, as extremely populous; though he esteems the number of its inhabitants to be diminished. <sc>Syria</sc>, and the Lesser <sc>Asia</sc>, as well as the coast of <sc>Barbary</sc>, I can readily own, to be desart in comparison of their ancient condition. The depopulation of <sc>Greece</sc> is also obvious. But whether the country now called <sc>Turky</sc> in <sc>Europe</sc> may not, in general, contain more inhabitants than during the flourishing period of <sc>Greece</sc>, may be a little doubtful. The <sc>Thracians</sc> seem then to have lived like the <sc>Tartars</sc> at present, by pasturage and plunder<footnote num="229" sym="*"/>: The <sc>Getes</sc> were still more uncivilized<footnote num="230" sym="†"/>: And the <sc>Illyrians</sc> were no better<footnote num="231" sym="‡"/>. These occupy nine-tenths of that country: And though the government of the <sc>Turks</sc> be not very favourable to industry and propagation; yet it preserves at least peace and order among the inhabitants; and is preferable to that barbarous, unsettled condition, in which they anciently lived.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 166"><para><sc>Poland</sc> and <sc>Muscovy</sc> in <sc>Europe</sc> are not populous; but are certainly much more so than the ancient <sc>Sarmatia</sc> and <sc>Scythia</sc>; where no husbandry or tillage was ever heard of, and pasturage was the sole art by which the people were maintained. The like observation may be extended to <sc>Denmark</sc> and <sc>Sweden</sc>. No one ought to esteem the immense swarms of people, which formerly came from the North, and <MPB ed="Mil" num="453"/>over-ran all <sc>Europe</sc>, to be any objection to this opinion. Where a whole nation, or even half of it remove their seat; it is easy to imagine, what a prodigious multitude they must form; with what desperate valour they must make their attacks; and how the terror they strike into the invaded nations will make these magnify, in their imagination, both the courage and multitude of the invaders. <sc>Scotland</sc> is neither extensive nor populous; but were the half of its inhabitants to seek new seats, they would form a colony as numerous as the <sc>Teutons</sc> and <sc>Cimbri</sc>; and would shake all <sc>Europe</sc>, supposing it in no better condition for defence than formerly.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 167"><para><sc>Germany</sc> has surely at present twenty times more inhabitants than in ancient times, when they cultivated no ground, and each tribe valued itself on the extensive desolation which it spread around; as we learn from <sc>C<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>sar</sc><footnote num="232" sym="*"/>, and <sc>Tacitus</sc><footnote num="233" sym="†"/>, and <sc>Strabo</sc><footnote num="234" sym="‡"/>.

<dhot id="PA 174"><para><sc>Spain</sc> is, perhaps, decayed from what it was three centuries ago; but if we step backward two thousand years, and <MPB ed="Mil" num="456"/>consider the restless, turbulent, unsettled condition of its inhabitants, we may probably be inclined to think, that it is now much more populous. Many <sc>Spaniards</sc> killed themselves, when deprived of their arms by the <sc>Romans</sc><footnote num="246" sym="‡"/>. It appears from <sc>Plutarch</sc><footnote num="247" sym="ǁ"/>, that robbery and plunder were esteemed honourable among the <sc>Spaniards</sc>. <sc>Hirtius</sc><footnote num="248" sym="ǁ"/> represents in the same light the situation of that country in <sc>C<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>sar</sc>’s time; and he says, that every man was obliged to live in castles and walled towns for his security.

The account which <sc>Strabo</sc><footnote num="250" sym="†"/> and <sc>Justin</sc><footnote num="251" sym="‡"/> give of <sc>Spain</sc>, corresponds exactly with those above mentioned. How much, therefore, must it diminish from our idea of the populousness of antiquity, when we find, that <sc>Tully</sc>, comparing <sc>Italy</sc>, <sc>Afric</sc>, <sc>Gaul</sc>, <sc>Greece</sc>, and <sc>Spain</sc>, mentions the great number of inhabitants, as the peculiar circumstance, which rendered this latter country formidable<footnote num="252" sym="†*"/>?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 175"><MPB ed="Mil" num="457"/><para><sc>Italy</sc>, however, it is probable, has decayed: But how many great cities does it still contain? <sc>Venice</sc>, <sc>Genoa</sc>, <sc>Pavia</sc>, <sc>Turin</sc>, <sc>Milan</sc>, <sc>Naples</sc>, <sc>Florence</sc>, <sc>Leghorn</sc>, which either subsisted not in ancient times, or were then very inconsiderable? If we reflect on this, we shall not be apt to carry matters to so great an extreme as is usual, with regard to this subject.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 176"><para>When the <sc>Roman</sc> authors complain, that <sc>Italy</sc>, which formerly exported corn, became dependent on all the provinces for its daily bread, they never ascribe this alteration to the encrease of its inhabitants, but to the neglect of tillage and agriculture<footnote num="253" sym="§"/>. A natural effect of that pernicious practice of importing corn, in order to distribute it <em>gratis</em> among the <sc>Roman</sc> citizens, and a very bad means of multiplying the inhabitants of any country<footnote num="254" sym="†"/>. The <em>sportula</em>, so much talked of by <sc>Martial</sc> and <sc>Juvenal</sc>, being presents regularly made by the great lords to their smaller clients, must have had a like tendency to produce idleness, debauchery, and a continual decay among the people. The parish-rates have at present the same bad consequences in <sc>England</sc>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 177"><para>Were I to assign a period, when I imagine this part of the world might possibly contain more inhabitants than at present, I should pitch upon the age of <sc>Trajan</sc> and the <sc>Anto<MPB ed="Mil" num="458"/>nines</sc>; the great extent of the <sc>Roman</sc> empire being then civilized and cultivated, settled almost in a profound peace both foreign and domestic, and living under the same regular police and government<footnote num="255" sym="‡"/>. But we are told, that all extensive <MPB ed="Mil" num="460"/>governments, especially absolute monarchies, are pernicious to population, and contain a secret vice and poison, which destroy the effect of all these promising appearances<footnote num="256" sym="*"/>. To confirm this, there is a passage cited from <sc>Plutarch</sc><footnote num="257" sym="ǁ"/>, which being somewhat singular, we shall here examine it.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 178"><para>That author, endeavouring to account for the silence of many of the oracles, says, that it may be ascribed to the present desolation of the world, proceeding from former wars and factions; which common calamity, he adds, has fallen heavier upon <sc>Greece</sc> than on any other country; insomuch, that the whole could scarcely at present furnish three thousand warriors; a number which, in the time of the <sc>Median</sc> war, <MPB ed="Mil" num="461"/>were supplied by the single city of <sc>Megara</sc>. The gods, therefore, who affect works of dignity and importance, have suppressed many of their oracles, and deign not to use so many interpreters of their will to so diminutive a people.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 179"><para>I must confess, that this passage contains so many difficulties, that I know not what to make of it. You may observe, that <sc>Plutarch</sc> assigns, for a cause of the decay of mankind, not the extensive dominion of the <sc>Romans</sc>, but the former wars and factions of the several states; all which were quieted by the <sc>Roman</sc> arms. <sc>Plutarch</sc>’s reasoning, therefore, is directly contrary to the inference, which is drawn from the fact he advances.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 180"><para><sc>Polybius</sc> supposes, that <sc>Greece</sc> had become more prosperous and flourishing after the establishment of the <sc>Roman</sc> yoke<footnote num="258" sym="*"/>; and though that historian wrote before these conquerors had degenerated, from being the patrons, to be the plunderers of mankind; yet as we find from <sc>Tacitus</sc><footnote num="259" sym="†"/>, that the severity of the emperors afterwards corrected the licence of the governors, we have no reason to think that extensive monarchy so destructive as it is often represented.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 181"><para>We learn from <sc>Strabo</sc><footnote num="260" sym="‡"/>, that the <sc>Romans</sc>, from their regard to the <sc>Greeks</sc>, maintained, to his time, most of the privileges and liberties of that celebrated nation; and <sc>Nero</sc> afterwards rather encreased them<footnote num="261" sym="ǁ"/>. How therefore can we <MPB ed="Mil" num="462"/>imagine, that the <sc>Roman</sc> yoke was so burdensome over that part of the world? The oppression of the proconsuls was checked; and the magistracies in <sc>Greece</sc> being all bestowed, in the several cities, by the free votes of the people, there was no necessity for the competitors to attend the emperor’s court. If great numbers went to seek their fortunes in <sc>Rome</sc>, and advance themselves by learning or eloquence, the commodities of their native country, many of them would return with the fortunes which they had acquired, and thereby enrich the <sc>Grecian</sc> commonwealths.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 182"><para>But <sc>Plutarch</sc> says, that the general depopulation had been more sensibly felt in <sc>Greece</sc> than in any other country. How is this reconcileable to its superior privileges and advantages?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 183"><para>Besides, this passage, by proving too much, really proves nothing. <em>Only three thousand men able to bear arms in all</em> <sc>Greece</sc>! Who can admit so strange a proposition, especially if we consider the great number of <sc>Greek</sc> cities, whose names still remain in history, and which are mentioned by writers long after the age of <sc>Plutarch</sc>? There are there surely ten times more people at present, when there scarcely remains a city in all the bounds of ancient <sc>Greece</sc>. That country is still tolerably cultivated, and furnishes a sure supply of corn, in case of any scarcity in <sc>Spain</sc>, <sc>Italy</sc>, or the south of <sc>France</sc>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 184"><para>We may observe, that the ancient frugality of the <sc>Greeks</sc>, and their equality of property, still subsisted during the age of <sc>Plutarch</sc>; as appears from <sc>Lucian</sc><footnote num="262" sym="†"/>. Nor is there any ground to imagine, that that country was possessed by a few masters, and a great number of slaves.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 185"><para>It is probable, indeed, that military discipline, being entirely useless, was extremely neglected in <sc>Greece</sc> after the establishment of the <sc>Roman</sc> empire; and if these commonwealths, formerly so warlike and ambitious, maintained each of them a small city-guard, to prevent mobbish disorders, it is <MPB ed="Mil" num="463"/>all they had occasion for: And these, perhaps, did not amount to 3000 men, throughout all <sc>Greece</sc>. I own, that, if <sc>Plutarch</sc> had this fact in his eye, he is here guilty of a gross paralogism, and assigns causes no wise proportioned to the effects. But is it so great a prodigy, that an author should fall into a mistake of this nature<footnote num="263" sym="†"/>?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA 186"><para>But whatever force may remain in this passage of <sc>Plutarch</sc>, we shall endeavour to counterbalance it by as remarkable a passage in <sc>Diodorus Siculus</sc>, where the historian, after mentioning <sc>Ninus</sc>’s army of 1,700,000 foot and <MPB ed="Mil" num="464"/>200,000 horse, endeavours to support the credibility of this account by some posterior facts; and adds, that we must not form a notion of the ancient populousness of mankind from the present emptiness and depopulation which is spread over the world<footnote num="264" sym="‡"/>. Thus an author, who lived at that very period of antiquity which is represented as most populous<footnote num="265" sym="ǁ"/>, complains of the desolation which then prevailed, gives the preference to former times, and has recourse to ancient fables as a foundation for his opinion. The humour of blaming the present, and admiring the past, is strongly rooted in human nature, and has an influence even on persons endued with the profoundest judgment and most extensive learning.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="PA [X].1"><para><ac><dc>A</dc>s</ac> <em>servus</em> was the name of the genus, and verna of the species, without any correlative, this forms a strong presumption, that the latter were by far the least numerous. It is an universal observation which we may form upon language, that where two related parts of a whole bear any proportion to each other, in numbers, rank or consideration, there are always correlative terms invented, which answer to both the parts, and express their mutual relation. If they bear no proportion to each other, the term is only invented for the less, and marks its distinction from the whole. Thus <em>man</em> and <em>woman</em>, <em>master</em> and <em>servant</em>, <em>father</em> and <em>son</em>, <em>prince</em> and <em>subject</em>, <em>stranger</em> and <em>citizen</em>, are correlative terms. But the words <em>seaman</em>, <em>carpenter</em>, <em>smith</em>, <em>tailor</em>, &amp;c. have no correspondent terms, which express those who are no seamen, no carpenters, <em>&amp;c.</em> Languages differ very much with regard to the particular words where this distinction obtains; and may thence afford very strong inferences, concerning the manners and customs of different nations. The military government of the <sc>Roman</sc> emperors had exalted the soldiery so high, that they balanced all the other orders of the state: Hence <em>miles</em> and <em>paganus</em> became relative terms; a thing, till then, unknown to ancient, and still so to modern languages. Modern superstition exalted the clergy so high, that they overbalanced the whole state: Hence <em>clergy</em> and <em>laity</em> are terms opposed in all modern languages; and in these alone. And from the same principles I infer, that if the number of slaves bought <OPB num="556"/>by the <sc>Romans</sc> from foreign countries, had not extremely exceeded those which were bred at home, <em>verna</em> would have had a correlative, which would have expressed the former species of slaves. But these, it would seem, composed the main body of the ancient slaves, and the latter were but a few exceptions.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="PA [MM].2"><para>All the best manuscripts of <sc>Pliny</sc> read the passage as here cited, and fix the compass of the walls of <sc>Rome</sc> to be thirteen miles. The question is, What <sc>Pliny</sc> means by 30,775 paces, and how that number was formed? The manner in which I conceive it, is this. <sc>Rome</sc> was a semicircular area of thirteen miles circumference. The Forum, and consequently the Milliarium, we know, was situated on the banks of the <sc>Tyber</sc>, and near the center of the circle, or upon the diameter of the semicircular area. Though there were thirty-seven gates to <sc>Rome</sc>, yet only twelve of them had straight streets, leading from them to the Milliarium. <sc>Pliny</sc>, therefore, having assigned the circumference of <sc>Rome</sc>, and knowing that that alone was not sufficient to give us a just notion of its surface, uses this farther method. He supposes all the streets, leading from the Milliarium to the twelve gates, to be laid together into one straight line, and supposes we run along that line, so as to count each gate once: In which case, he says, that the whole line is 30,775 paces: Or, in other words, that each street or radius of the semicircular area is upon an average two miles and a half; and the whole length of <sc>Rome</sc> is five miles, and its breadth about half as much, besides the scattered suburbs.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA [MM].3"><para><sc>Pere Hardouin</sc> understands this passage in the same manner; with regard to <MPB ed="Mil" num="440"/>the laying together the several streets of <sc>Rome</sc> into one line, in order to compose 30,775 paces: But then he supposes, that streets led from the Milliarium to every gate, and that no street exceeded 800 paces in length. But <OPB num="564"/>(1.) a semicircular area, whose radius was only 800 paces, could never have a circumference near thirteen miles, the compass of <sc>Rome</sc> as assigned by <sc>Pliny</sc>. A radius of two miles and a half forms very nearly that circumference. (2.) There is an absurdity in supposing a city so built as to have streets running to its center from every gate in its circumference. These streets must interfere as they approach. (3.) This diminishes too much from the greatness of ancient <sc>Rome</sc>, and reduces that city below even <sc>Bristol</sc> or <sc>Rotterdam</sc>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="PA [MM].4"><para>The sense which <sc>Vossius</sc> in his <em>Observationes vari<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins></em> puts on this passage of <sc>Pliny</sc>, errs widely in the other extreme. One manuscript of no authority, instead of thirteen miles, has assigned thirty miles for the compass of the walls of <sc>Rome</sc>. And <sc>Vossius</sc> understands this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference; supposing, that as the <sc>Tyber</sc> formed the diameter, there were no walls built on that side. But (1.) this reading is allowed to be contrary to almost all the manuscripts. (2.) Why should <sc>Pliny</sc>, a concise writer, repeat the compass of the walls of <sc>Rome</sc> in two successive sentences? (3.) Why repeat it with so sensible a variation? (4.) What is the meaning of <sc>Pliny</sc>’s mentioning twice the <sc>Milliarium</sc>, if a line was measured that had no dependence on the <sc>Milliarium</sc>? (5.) <sc>Aurelian</sc>’s wall is said by <sc>Vopiscus</sc> to have been drawn <em>laxiore ambitu</em>, and to have comprehended all the buildings and suburbs on the north side of the <sc>Tyber</sc>; yet its compass was only fifty miles; and even here critics suspect some mistake or corruption in the text; since the walls, which remain, and which are supposed to be the same with <sc>Aurelian</sc>’s, exceed not twelve miles. It is not probable, that <sc>Rome</sc> would diminish from <sc>Augustus</sc> to <sc>Aurelian</sc>. It remained still the capital of the same empire; and none of the civil wars in that long period, except the tumults on the death of <sc>Maximus</sc> and <sc>Balbinus</sc>, ever affected the city. <sc>Caracalla</sc> is said by <sc>Aurelius Victor</sc> to have encreased <sc>Rome</sc>. (6.) There are no remains of ancient buildings, which mark any such greatness of <sc>Rome</sc>. <sc>Vossius</sc>’s reply to this objection seems absurd, that the rubbish would sink sixty or seventy feet under ground. It appears from <sc>Spartian</sc> (<em>in vita Severi</em>) that the five-mile stone <em>in via Lavicana</em> was <OPB num="565"/>out of the city. (7.) <sc>Olympiodorus</sc> and <sc>Publius Victor</sc> fix the number of houses in <sc>Rome</sc> to be betwixt forty and fifty thousand. (8.) The very extravagance of the consequences drawn by this critic, as well as <sc>Lipsius</sc><MPB ed="Mil" num="441"/>, if they be necessary, destroys the foundation on which they are grounded: That <sc>Rome</sc> contained fourteen millions of inhabitants; while the whole kingdom of <sc>France</sc> contains only five, according to his computation, &amp;c.</para></dhot>

But as <sc>Pliny</sc> was writing to the <sc>Romans</sc>, who perfectly knew the disposition of the streets, it is not strange he should take a circumstance for granted, which was so familiar to every body.

<dhot id="PA [SS].3"><para>And here I cannot but observe, that Mons. <sc>Fontenelle</sc>, a writer eminent for candor, seems to have departed a little from his usual character, when he endeavours to throw a ridicule upon <sc>Plutarch</sc> on account of passages to be met with in this dialogue concerning oracles. The absurdities here put into the mouths of the several personages are not to be ascribed to <sc>Plutarch</sc>. He makes them refute each other; and, in general, he seems to intend the ridiculing of those very opinions, which <sc>Fontenelle</sc> would ridicule him for maintaining. See <em>Histoire des oracles</em>.</para></dhot>
