<dhot id="M Dial.1"><para><ac><dc>M</dc>y</ac> friend, <sc>Palamedes</sc>, who is as great a rambler in his principles as in his person, and who has run over, by study and travel, almost every region of the intellectual and material world, surprized me lately with an account of a nation, with whom, he told me, he had passed a considerable part of his life, and whom, he found, in the main, a people extremely civilized and intelligent.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.2"><para>There is a country, said he, in the world, called <sc>Fourli</sc>, no matter for its longitude or latitude, whose inhabitants have ways of thinking, in many things, particularly in morals, diametrically opposite to ours. When I came among them, I found that I must submit to double pains; first to learn the meaning of the terms in their language, and then to know the import of those terms, and the praise or blame attached to them. After a word had been explained to me, and the character, which it expressed, had been described, I concluded, that such an epithet must necessarily be the greatest reproach in the world; and was extremely surprized to find one in a public company, apply it to a person, with whom he lived in the strictest intimacy and friendship. <em>You fancy</em>, said I, one day, to an acquaintance, <em>that</em> <sc>Changius</sc> <em>is your mortal enemy: I love to extinguish quarrels</em>; <em>and I must, therefore, tell you, that I heard him talk of you in the most obliging manner</em>. But to my great astonishment, <OPB num="378"/>when I repeated <sc>Changuis</sc>’s words, though I had both remembered and understood them perfectly, I found, that they were <MPB ed="SBN" num="325"/>taken for the most mortal affront, and that I had very innocently rendered the breach between these persons altogether irreparable.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.3"><para>As it was my fortune to come among this people on a very advantageous footing, I was immediately introduced to the best company; and being desired by <sc>Alcheic</sc> to live with him, I readily accepted of his invitation; as I found him universally esteemed for his personal merit, and indeed regarded by every one in <sc>Fourli</sc>, as a perfect character.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.4"><para>One evening he invited me, as an amusement, to bear him company in a serenade, which he intended to give to <sc>Gulki</sc>, with whom, he told me, he was extremely enamoured; and I soon found that his taste was not singular: For we met many of his rivals, who had come on the same errand. I very naturally concluded, that this mistress of his must be one of the finest women in town; and I already felt a secret inclination to see her, and be acquainted with her. But as the moon began to rise, I was much surprized to find, that we were in the midst of the unversity, where <sc>Gulki</sc> studied: And I was somewhat ashamed for having attended my friend, on such an errand.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.5"><para>I was afterwards told, that <sc>Alcheic</sc>’s choice of <sc>Gulki</sc> was very much approved of by all the good company in town; and that it was expected, while he gratified his own passion, he would perform to that young man the same good office, which he had himself owed to <sc>Elcouf</sc>. If seems <sc>Alcheic</sc> had been very handsome in his youth, and been courted by many lovers; but had bestowed his favours chiefly on the sage <sc>Elcouf</sc>; to whom he was supposed to owe, in a great measure, <OPB num="379"/>the astonishing progress which he had made in philosophy and virtue.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.6"><para>It gave me some surprize, that <sc>Alcheic</sc>’s wife (who by-the-bye happened also to be his sister) was no wise scandalized at this species of infidelity.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.7"><para>Much about the same time I discovered (for it was not <MPB ed="SBN" num="326"/>attempted to be kept a secret from me or any body) that <sc>Alcheic</sc> was a murderer and a parricide, and had put to death an innocent person, the most nearly connected with him, and whom he was bound to protect and defend by all the ties of nature and humanity. When I asked, with all the caution and deference imaginable, what was his motive for this action; he replied coolly, that he was not then so much at ease in his circumstances as he is at present, and that he had acted, in that particular, by the advice of all his friends.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.8"><para>Having heard <sc>Alcheic</sc>’s virtue so extremely celebrated, I pretended to join in the general voice of acclamation, and only asked, by way of curiosity, as a stranger, which of all his noble actions was most highly applauded; and I soon found, that all sentiments were united in giving preference to the assassination of <sc>Usbek</sc>. This <sc>Usbek</sc> has been to the last moment <sc>Alcheic</sc>’s intimate friend, had laid many high obligations upon him, had even saved his life on a certain occasion, and had, by his will, which was found after the murder, made him heir to a considerable part of his fortune. <sc>Alcheic</sc>, it seems, conspired with about twenty or thirty more, most of them also <sc>Usbek</sc>’s friends; and falling all together on that unhappy man, when he was not aware, they had torne him with a hundred wounds; and given him that reward for all his past favours and obligations. <sc>Usbek</sc>, said the general voice of the people, had many great and good qualities: His very vices were shin<OPB num="380"/>ing, magnificent, and generous: But this action of <sc>Alcheic</sc>’s sets him far above <sc>Usbek</sc> in the eyes of all judges of merit; and is one of the noblest that ever perhaps the sun shone upon.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.9"><para>Another part of <sc>Alcheic</sc>’s conduct, which I also found highly applauded, was his behaviour towards <sc>Calish</sc>, with whom he was joined in a project or undertaking of some importance. <sc>Calish</sc>, being a passionate man, gave <sc>Alcheic</sc>, one day, a sound drubbing; which he took very patiently, waited the return of <sc>Calish</sc>’s good-humour, kept still a fair <MPB ed="SBN" num="327"/>correspondence with him; and by that means brought the affair, in which they were joined, to a happy issue, and gained to himself immortal honour by his remarkable temper and moderation.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.10"><para>I have lately received a letter from a correspondent in <sc>Fourli</sc>, by which I learn, that, since my departure, <sc>Alcheic</sc>, falling into a bad state of health, has fairly hanged himself; and has died universally regretted and applauded in that country. So virtuous and noble a life, says each <sc>Fourlian</sc>, could not be better crowned than by so noble an end; and <sc>Alcheic</sc> has proved by this, as well as by all his other actions, what was his constant principle during his life, and what be boasted of near his last moments, that a wise man is scarcely inferior to the great god, <sc>Vitzli</sc>. This is the name of the supreme deity among the <sc>Fourlians</sc>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.11"><para>The notions of this people, continued <sc>Palamedes</sc>, are as extraordinary with regard to good-manners and sociableness, as with regard to morals. My friend <sc>Alcheic</sc> formed once a party for my entertainment, composed of all the prime wits and philosophers of <sc>Fourli</sc>; and each of us brought his mess along with him to the place where we assembled. I observed one of them to be worse provided than the rest, and offered him a share of <OPB num="381"/>my mess, which happened to be a roasted pullet: And I could not but remark, that he and all the rest of the company smiled at my simplicity. I was told, that <sc>Alcheic</sc> had once so much interest with his club as to prevail with them to eat in common, and that he had made use of an artifice for that purpose. He persuaded those, whom he observed to be <em>worst</em> provided, to offer their mess to the company; after which, the others who had brought more delicate fare, were ashamed not to make the same offer. This is regarded as so extraordinary an event, that it has since, as I learn, been recorded in the history of <sc>Alcheic</sc>’s life, composed by one of the greatest geniuses of <sc>Fourli</sc>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.12"><para>Pray, said I, <sc>Palamedes</sc>, when you were at <sc>Fourli</sc>, did you <MPB ed="SBN" num="328"/>also learn the art of turning your friends into ridicule, by telling them such strange stories, and then laughing at them, if they believed you. I assure you, replied he, had I been disposed to learn such a lesson, there was no place in the world more proper. My friend, so often mentioned, did nothing, from morning to night, but sneer, and banter, and rally; and you could scarcely ever distinguish, whether he were in jest or earnest. But you think then, that my story is improbable; and that I have used, or rather abused the privilege of a traveller. To be sure, said I, you were but in jest. Such barbarous and savage manners are not only incompatible with a civilized, intelligent people, such as you said these were; but are scarcely compatible with human nature. They exceed all we ever read of, among the <sc>Mingrelians</sc>, and <sc>Topinamboues</sc>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.13"><para>Have a care, cried he, have a care! You are not aware that you are speaking blasphemy, and are abusing your favourites, the <sc>Greeks</sc>, especially the <sc>Athenians</sc>, whom I have couched, all along, under these bizare <OPB num="382"/>names I employed. If you consider aright, there is not one stroke of the foregoing character, which might not be found in the man of highest merit at <sc>Athens</sc>, without diminishing in the least from the brightness of his character. The amours of the <sc>Greeks</sc>, their marriages<footnote num="79" sym="*"/>, and the exposing of their children cannot but strike you immediately. The death of <sc>Usbek</sc> is an exact counter-part to that of <sc>C<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>sar</sc>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.14"><para>All to a trifle, said I, interrupting him: You did not mention that <sc>Usbek</sc> was an usurper.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.15"><para>I did not, replied he; lest you should discover the parallel I aimed at. But even adding this circumstance, we should make no scruple, according to our sentiments or morals, to denominate <sc>Brutus</sc>, and <sc>Cassius</sc>, ungrateful <MPB ed="SBN" num="329"/>traitors and assassins: Though you know, that they are, perhaps, the highest characters of all antiquity; and the <sc>Athenians</sc> erected statues to them; which they placed near those of <sc>Harmodius</sc> and <sc>Aristogiton</sc>, their own deliverers. And if you think this circumstance, which you mention, so material to absolve these patriots, I shall compensate it by another, not mentioned, which will equally aggravate their crime. A few days before the execution of their fatal purpose, they all swore fealty to <sc>C<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>sar</sc>; and protesting to hold his person ever sacred, they touched the altar with those hands, which they had already armed for his destruction<footnote num="80" sym="†"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.16"><para>I need not remind you of the famous and applauded story of <sc>Themistocles</sc>, and of his patience towards <sc>Eurybiades</sc>, the <sc>Spartan</sc>, his commanding officer, who, heated by debate, lifted his cane to him in <OPB num="383"/>a council of war (the same thing as if he had cudgelled him), <em>Strike!</em> cries the <sc>Athenian</sc>, <em>strike! but hear me</em>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.17"><para>You are too good a scholar not to discover the ironical <sc>Socrates</sc> and his <sc>Athenian</sc> club in my last story; and you will certainly observe, that it is exactly copied from <sc>Xenophon</sc>, with a variation only of the names<footnote num="81" sym="*"/>. And I think I have fairly made it appear, that an <sc>Athenian</sc> man of merit might be such a one as with us would pass for incestuous, a parricide, an assassin, an ungrateful, perjured traitor, and something else too abominable to be named; not to mention his rusticity and ill-manners. And having lived in this manner, his death might be entirely suitable: He might conclude the scene by a desperate act of self-murder, and die with the most absurd blasphemies in his mouth. And notwithstanding all this, he shall have statues, if not altars, erected to his praise; great sects shall be proud of calling themselves by his name; and the most distant posterity shall blindly <MPB ed="SBN" num="330"/>continue their admiration: Though were such a one to arise among ourselves, they would justly regard him with horror and execration.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.18"><para>I might have been aware, replied I, of your artifice. You seem to take pleasure in this topic: and are indeed the only man I ever knew, who was well acquainted with the ancients, and did not extremely admire them. But instead of attacking their philosophy, their eloquence, or poetry, the usual subjects of controversy between us, you now seem to impeach their morals, and accuse them of ignorance in a science, which is the only one, in my opinion, in which they are not surpassed by the moderns. Geometry, physics, astronomy, anatomy, botany, geo<OPB num="384"/>graphy, navigation; in these we justly claim the superiority: But what have we to oppose in their moralists? Your representation of things is fallacious. You have no indulgence for the manners and customs of different ages. Would you try a <sc>Greek</sc> or <sc>Roman</sc> by the common law of <sc>England</sc>? Hear him defend himself by his own maxims; and then pronounce.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.19"><para>There are no manners so innocent or reasonable, but may be rendered odious or ridiculous, if measured by a standard, unknown to the persons; especially, if you employ a little art or eloquence, in aggravating some circumstances, and extenuating others, as best suits the purpose of your discourse. All these artifices may easily be retorted on you. Could I inform the <sc>Athenians</sc>, for instance, that there was a nation, in which adultery, both active and passive, so to speak, was in the highest vogue and esteem: In which every man of education chose for his mistress a married woman, the wife, perhaps, of his friend and companion; and valued himself upon these infamous conquests, as much as if he had been several times a conqueror in boxing or wrestling at the <em>Olympic</em> games: In which every man also took a pride in his tameness and facility with regard to his own wife, and was glad to make friends or gain interest by allowing her to <MPB ed="SBN" num="331"/>prostitute her charms; and even, without any such motive, gave her full liberty and indulgence: I ask, what sentiments the <sc>Athenians</sc> would entertain of such a people; they who never mentioned the crime of adultery but in conjunction with robbery and poisoning? Which would they admire most, the villany or the meanness of such a conduct?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.20"><para>Should I add, that the same people were as proud of their slavery and dependance as the <sc>Athenians</sc> of their liberty; and though a man among them were oppressed, <OPB num="385"/>disgraced, impoverished, insulted, or imprisoned by the tyrant, he would still regard it as the highest merit to love, serve, and obey him; and even to die for his smallest glory or satisfaction: These noble <sc>Greeks</sc> would probably ask me, whether I spoke of a human society, or some inferior, servile species.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.21"><para>It was then that I might inform my <sc>Athenian</sc> audience, that these people, however, wanted not spirit and bravery. If a man, say I, though their intimate friend, should throw out, in a private company, a raillery against them, nearly approaching any of those, with which your generals and demagogues every day regale each other, in the face of the whole city, they never can forgive him; but in order to revenge themselves, they oblige him immediately to run them through the body, or be himself murdered. And if a man, who is an absolute stranger to them, should desire them, at the peril of their own life, to cut the throat of their bosom-companion, they immediately obey, and think themselves highly obliged and honoured by the commission. These are their maxims of honour: This is their favourite morality.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.22"><para>But though so ready to draw their sword against their friends and countrymen; no disgrace, no infamy, no pain, no poverty will ever engage these people to turn the point against their own breast. A man of rank would row in the gallies, would beg his bread, would languish in prison, would suffer any tortures; and still preserve his wretched <MPB ed="SBN" num="332"/>life. Rather than escape his enemies by a generous contempt of death, he would infamously receive the same death from his enemies, aggravated by their triumphant insults, and by the most exquisite sufferings.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.23"><para>It is very usual too, continue I, among this people to erect jails, where every art of plaguing and tormenting <OPB num="386"/>the unhappy prisoners is carefully studied and practiced: And in these jails it is usual for a parent voluntarily to shut up several of his children; in order, that another child, whom he owns to have no greater or rather less merit than the rest, may enjoy his whole fortune, and wallow in every kind of voluptuousness and pleasure. Nothing so virtuous in their opinion as this barbarous partiality.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.24"><para>But what is more singular in this whimsical nation, say I to the <sc>Athenians</sc>, is, that a frolic of yours during the <sc>Saturnalia</sc><footnote num="82" sym="*"/>, when the slaves are served by their masters, is seriously continued by them throughout the whole year, and throughout the whole course of their lives; accompanied too with some circumstances, which still farther augment the absurdity and ridicule. Your sport only elevates for a few days those whom fortune has thrown down, and whom she too, in sport, may really elevate for ever above you: But this nation gravely exalts those, whom nature has subjected to them, and whose inferiority and infirmities are absolutely incurable. The women, though without virtue, are their masters and sovereigns: These they reverence, praise, and magnify: To these, they pay the highest deference and respect: And in all places and all times, the superiority of the females is readily acknowledged and submitted to by every one, who has the least pretensions to education and politeness. Scarce any crime would be so universally detested as an infraction of this rule.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.25"><para>You need go no farther, replied <sc>Palamedes</sc>; I can easily <MPB ed="SBN" num="333"/>conjecture the people whom you aim at. The strokes, with which you have painted them, are pretty just; and yet you must acknowledge, that scarce any people are to be found, either in ancient or modern <OPB num="387"/>times, whose national character is, upon the whole, less liable to exception. But I give you thanks for helping me out with my argument. I had no intention of exalting the moderns at the expence of the ancients. I only meant to represent the uncertainty of all these judgments concerning characters; and to convince you, that fashion, vogue, custom, and law, were the cheif foundation of all moral determinations. The <sc>Athenians</sc> surely, were a civilized, intelligent people, if ever there were one; and yet their man of merit might, in this age, be held in horror and execration. The <sc>French</sc> are also, without doubt, a very civilized, intelligent people; and yet their man of merit might, with the <sc>Athenians</sc>, be an object of the highest contempt and ridicule, and even hatred. And what renders the matter more extraordinary: These two people are supposed to be the most similar in their national character of any in ancient and modern times; and while the <sc>English</sc> flatter themselves that they resemble the <sc>Romans</sc>, their neighbours on the continent draw the parallel between themselves and those polite <sc>Greeks</sc>. What wide difference, therefore, in the sentiments of morals, must be found between civilized nations and Barbarians, or between nations whose characters have little in common? How shall we pretend to fix a standard for judgments of this nature?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.26"><para>By tracing matters, replied I, a little higher, and examining the first principles, which each nation establishes, of blame or censure. The <sc>Rhine</sc> flows north, the <sc>Rhone</sc> south; yet both spring from the <em>same</em> mountain, and are also actuated, in their opposite directions, by the <em>same</em> principle of gravity. The different inclinations of the ground, on which they run, cause all the difference in their courses.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.27"><para>In how many circumstances would an <sc>Athenian</sc> and <MPB ed="SBN" num="334"/>a <sc>French</sc> man of merit resemble each other? Good sense, knowledge, wit, eloquence, humanity, fidelity, truth, justice, courage, temperance, constancy, dignity of mind: These you have all omitted; in order to insist only on the points, in which they may, by accident, differ. Very well: I am willing to comply with you; and shall endeavour to account for these differences from the most universal, established principles of morals.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.28"><para>The <sc>Greek</sc> loves, I care not to examine more particularly. I shall only observe, that, however blameable, they arose from a very innocent cause, the frequency of the gymnastic exercises among that people; and were recommended, though absurdly, as the source of friendship, sympathy, mutual attachment, and fidelity<footnote num="83" sym="*"/>; qualties esteemed in all nations and ages.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.29"><para>The marriage of half-brothers and sisters seems no great difficulty. Love between nearer relations is contrary to reason and public utility; but the precise point, where we are to stop, can scarcely be determined by natural reason; and is therefore a very proper subject for a municipal law or custom. If the <sc>Athenians</sc> went a little too far on the one side, the canon law has surely pushed matters a great way into the other extreme<footnote num="84" sym="†"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.30"><para>Had you asked a parent at <sc>Athens</sc>, why he bereaved his child of that life, which he had so lately given it. It is because I love it, he would reply; and regard the poverty which it must inherit from me, as a greater evil than death, which it is not capable of dreading, feeling, or resenting<footnote num="85" sym="‡"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.31"><para>How is public liberty, the most valuable of all blessings, to be recovered from the hands of an usurper or <OPB num="389"/>tyrant, if his power shields him from public rebellion, and our scruples from private vengeance? That his crime is capital by law, <MPB ed="SBN" num="335"/>you acknowledge: And must the highest aggravation of his crime, the putting of himself above law, form his full security? You can reply nothing, but by showing the great inconveniences of assassination; which could any one have proved clearly to the ancients, he had reformed their sentiments in this particular.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.32"><para>Again, to cast your eye on the picture which I have drawn of modern manners; there is almost as great a difficulty, I acknowledge, to justify <sc>French</sc> as <sc>Greek</sc> gallantry; except only, that the former is much more natural and agreeable than the latter. But our neighbours, it seems, have resolved to sacrifice some of the domestic to the sociable pleasures; and to prefer ease, freedom, and an open commerce, to a strict fidelity and constancy. These ends are both good, and are somewhat difficult to reconcile; nor need we be surprised, if the customs of nations incline too much, sometimes to the one side, sometimes to the other.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.33"><para>The most inviolable attachment to the laws of our country is every where acknowledged a capital virtue; and where the people are not so happy, as to have any legislature but a single person, the strictest loyalty is, in that case, the truest patriotism.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.34"><para>Nothing surely can be more absurd and barbarous than the practice of duelling; but those, who justify it, say, that it begets civility and good-manners. And a duellist, you may observe, always values himself upon his courage, his sense of honour, his fidelity and friendship; qualities, which are here indeed very oddly directed, but which have been esteemed universally, since the foundation of the world.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.35"><para>Have the gods forbid self-murder? An <sc>Athenian</sc> allows, that it ought to be forborn. Has the Deity permitted it? A <sc>Frenchman</sc> allows, that death is preferable to pain and infamy.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.36"><para>You see then, continued I, that the principles upon which men reason in morals are always the same; though the <MPB ed="SBN" num="336"/>conclusions which they draw are often very different. That they all reason aright with regard to this subject, more than with regard to any other, it is not incumbent on any moralist to show. It is sufficient, that the original principles of censure or blame are uniform, and that erroneous conclusions can be corrected by sounder reasoning and a larger experience. Though many ages have elapsed since the fall of <sc>Greece</sc> and <sc>Rome</sc>; though many changes have arrived in religion, language, laws, and customs; none of these revolutions has ever produced any considerable innovation in the primary sentiments of morals, more than in those of external beauty. Some minute differences, perhaps, may be observed in both. <sc>Horace</sc><footnote num="86" sym="*"/> celebrates a low forehead, and <sc>Anacreon</sc> joined eye-brows<footnote num="87" sym="†"/>: But the <sc>Apollo</sc> and the <sc>Venus</sc> of antiquity are still our models for male and female beauty; in like manner as the character of <sc>Scipio</sc> continues our standard for the glory of heroes, and that of <sc>Cornelia</sc> for the honour of matrons.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.37"><para>It appears, that there never was any quality recommended by any one, as a virtue or moral excellence, but on account of its being <em>useful</em>, or <em>agreeable</em> to a man <em>himself</em>, or to <em>others</em>. For what other reason can ever be assigned for praise or approbation? Or where would be the sense of extolling a <em>good</em> character or action, which, <OPB num="391"/>at the same time, is allowed to be <em>good for nothing?</em> All the differences, therefore, in morals, may be reduced to this one general foundation, and may be accounted for by the different views, which people take of these circumstances.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.38"><para>Sometimes men differ in their judgment about the usefulness of any habit or action: Sometimes also the peculiar circumstances of things render one moral quality more useful than others, and give it a peculiar preference.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.39"><MPB ed="SBN" num="337"/><para>It is not surprising, that, during a period of war and disorder, the military virtues should be more celebrated than the pacific, and attract more the admiration and attention of mankind. “How useful is it,” says <sc>Tully</sc><footnote num="88" sym="*"/>, “to find <sc>Cimbrians</sc>, <sc>Celtiberians</sc>, and other Barbarians, who bear, with inflexible constancy, all the fatigues and dangers of the field; but are immediately dispirited under the pain and hazard of a languishing distemper: While, on the other hand, the <sc>Greeks</sc> patiently endure the slow approaches of death, when armed with sickness and disease; but timorously fly his presence, when he attacks them violently with swords and falchions!” So different is even the same virtue of courage among warlike or peaceful nations! And indeed, we may observe, that, as the difference between war and peace is the greatest that arises among nations and public societies, it produces also the greatest variations in moral sentiment, and diversifies the most our ideas of virtue and personal merit.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.40"><para>Sometimes too, magnanimity, greatness of mind, disdain of slavery, inflexible rigour and integrity, may better suit the circumstances of one age than those of another, and have a more kindly influence, both on <OPB num="392"/>public affairs, and on a man’s own safety and advancement. Our idea of merit, therefore, will also vary a little with these variations; and <sc>Labeo</sc>, perhaps, be censured for the same qualities, which procured <sc>Cato</sc> the highest approbation.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.41"><para>A degree of luxury may be ruinous and pernicious in a native of <sc>Switzerland</sc>, which only fosters the arts, and encourages industry in a <sc>Frenchman</sc> or <sc>Englishman</sc>. We are not, therefore, to expect, either the same sentiments, or the same laws in <sc>Berne</sc>, which prevail in <sc>London</sc> or <sc>Paris</sc>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.42"><para>Different customs have also some influence as well as different utilities; and by giving an early biass to the mind, may produce a superior propensity, either to the useful or <MPB ed="SBN" num="338"/>the agreeable qualities; to those which regard self, or those which extend to society. These four sources of moral sentiment still subsist; but particular accidents may, at one time, make any one of them flow with greater abundance than at another.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.43"><para>The customs of some nations shut up the women from all social commerce: Those of others make them so essential a part of society and conversation, that, except where business is transacted, the male-sex alone are supposed almost wholly incapable of mutual discourse and entertainment. As this difference is the most material that can happen in private life, it must also produce the greatest variation in our moral sentiments.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.44"><para>Of the nations in the world, where polygamy was not allowed, the <sc>Greeks</sc> seem to have been the most reserved in their commerce with the fair sex, and to have imposed on them the strictest laws of modesty and decency. We have a strong instance of this in an oration of <sc>Lysias</sc><footnote num="89" sym="†"/>. A widow injured, ruined, undone, calls a <OPB num="393"/>meeting of a few of her nearest friends and relations; and though never before accustomed, says the orator, to speak in the presence of men, the distress of her circumstances constrained her to lay the case before them. The very opening of her mouth in such company required, it seems, an apology.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.45"><para>When <sc>Demosthenes</sc> prosecuted his tutors, to make them refund his patrimony, it became necessary for him, in the course of the law-suit, to prove that the marriage of <sc>Aphobus</sc>’s sister with <sc>Oneter</sc> was entirely fraudulent, and that, notwithstanding her sham marriage, she had lived with her brother at <sc>Athens</sc> for two years past, ever since her divorce from her former husband. And it is remarkable, that though these were people of the first fortune and distinction in the city, the orator could prove this fact no way, but by <MPB ed="SBN" num="339"/>calling for her female slaves to be put to the question, and by the evidence of one physician, who had seen her in her brother’s house during her illness<footnote num="90" sym="†"/>. So reserved were <sc>Greek</sc> manners.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.46"><para>We may be assured, that an extreme purity of manners was the consequence of this reserve. Accordingly we find, that, except the fabulous stories of <sc>Helen</sc> and <sc>Clytemnestra</sc>, there scarcely is an instance of any event in the <sc>Greek</sc> history, which proceeded from the intrigues of women. On the other hand, in modern times, particularly in a neighbouring nation, the females enter into all transactions and all management of church and state: And no man can expect success, who takes not care to obtain their good graces. <sc>Harry</sc> the third, by incurring the displeasure of the fair, endangered his crown, and lost his life, as much as by his indulgence to heresy.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.47"><para>It is needless to dissemble: The consequence of a very free commerce between the sexes, and of their living much together, will often terminate in intrigues of gallantry. We must sacrifice somewhat of the <em>useful</em>, if we be very anxious to obtain all the <em>agreeable</em> qualities; and cannot pretend to reach alike every kind of advantage. Instances of licence, daily multiplying, will weaken the scandal with the one sex, and teach the other, by degrees, to adopt the famous maxim of <sc>La Fontaine</sc>, with regard to female infidelity, <em>that if one knows it, it is but a small matter; if one knows it not, it is nothing</em><footnote num="91" sym="*"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.48"><para>Some people are inclined to think, that the best way of adjusting all the differences, and of keeping the proper medium between the <em>agreeable</em> and the <em>useful</em> qualities of the sex, is to live with them after the manner of the <sc>Romans</sc> and the <sc>English</sc> (for the customs of these two nations seem similar <MPB ed="SBN" num="340"/>in this respect<footnote num="92" sym="†"/>); that is, without gallantry<footnote num="93" sym="‡"/>, and without jealousy. By a parity of reason, the customs of the <sc>Spaniards</sc> and of the <sc>Italians</sc> of an age ago (for the present are very different) must be the worst of any; because they favour both gallantry and jealousy.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.49"><para>Nor will these different customs of nations affect the one sex only: Their idea of personal merit in the males must also be somewhat different with regard, at least, to conversation, address, and humour. The one nation, where the men live much apart, will naturally more approve of prudence; the other of gaiety. With the one <OPB num="395"/>simplicity of manners will be in the highest esteem; with the other, politeness. The one will distinguish themselves by good-sense and judgment; the other, by taste and delicacy. The eloquence of the former will shine most in the senate; that of the other, on the theatre.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.50"><para>These, I say, are the <em>natural</em> effects of such customs. For it must be confessed, that chance has a great influence on national manners; and many events happen in society, which are not to be accounted for by general rules. Who could imagine, for instance, that the <sc>Romans</sc>, who lived freely with their women, should be very indifferent about music, and esteem dancing infamous: While the <sc>Greeks</sc>, who never almost saw a woman but in their own houses, were continually piping, singing, and dancing?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.51"><para>The differences of moral sentiment, which naturally arise from a republican or monarchical government, are also very obvious; as well as those which proceed from general riches <MPB ed="SBN" num="341"/>or poverty, union or faction, ignorance or learning. I shall conclude this long discourse with observing, that different customs and situations vary not the original ideas of merit (however they may, some consequences) in any very essential point, and prevail chiefly with regard to young men, who can aspire to the agreeable qualities, and may attempt to please. The MANNER, the ORNAMENTS, the GRACES, which succeed in this shape, are more arbitrary and casual: But the merit of riper years is almost every where the same; and consists chiefly in integrity, humanity, ability, knowledge, and the other more solid and useful qualities of the human mind.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.52"><para>What you insist on, replied <sc>Palamedes</sc>, may have some foundation, when you adhere to the maxims of common life and ordinary conduct. Experience and the <OPB num="396"/>practice of the world readily correct any great extravagance on either side. But what say you to <em>artificial</em> lives and manners? How do you reconcile the maxims, on which, in different ages and nations, these are founded?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.53"><para>What do you understand by <em>artificial</em> lives and manners? said I. I explain myself, replied he. You know, that religion had, in ancient times, very little influence on common life, and that, after men had performed their duty in sacrifices and prayers at the temple, they thought, that the gods left the rest of their conduct to themselves, and were little pleased or offended with those virtues or vices, which only affected the peace and happiness of human society. In those ages, it was the business of philosophy alone to regulate men’s ordinary behaviour and deportment; and accordingly, we may observe, that this being the sole principle, by which a man could elevate himself above his fellows, it acquired a mighty ascendant over many, and produced great singularities of maxims and of conduct. At present, when philosophy has lost the allurement of novelty, it has no such extensive influence; but seems to confine itself mostly to speculations in the closet; in the same manner, as the <MPB ed="SBN" num="342"/>ancient religion was limited to sacrifices in the temple. Its place is now supplied by the modern religion, which inspects our whole conduct, and prescribes an universal rule to our actions, to our words, to our very thoughts and inclinations; a rule so much the more austere, as it is guarded by infinite, though distant, rewards and punishments; and no infaction of it can ever be concealed or disguised.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.54"><para><sc>Diogenes</sc> is the most celebrated model of extravagant philosophy. Let us seek a parallel to him in modern times. We shall not disgrace any philosphic name by a comparison with the <sc>Dominics</sc> or <sc>Loyolas</sc>, or <OPB num="397"/>any canonized monk or friar. Let us compare him to <sc>Pascal</sc>, a man of parts and genius as well as <sc>Diogenes</sc> himself; and perhaps too, a man or virtue, had he allowed his virtuous inclinations to have exerted and displayed themselves.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.55"><para>The foundation of <sc>Diogenes</sc>’s conduct was an endeavour to render himself an indpendent being as much as possible, and to confine all his wants and desires and pleasures within himself and his own mind: The aim of <sc>Pascal</sc> was to keep a perpetual sense of his dependence before his eyes, and never to forget his numberless wants and infirmites. The ancient supported himself by magnanimity, ostentation, pride, and the idea of his own superiority above his fellow-creatures. The modern made constant profession of humility and abasement, of the contempt and hatred of himself; and endeavoured to attain these supposed virtues, as far as they are attainable. The austerities of the <sc>Greek</sc> were in order to inure himself to hardships, and prevent his ever suffering: Those of the <sc>Frenchman</sc> were embraced merely for their own sake, and in order to suffer as much as possible. The philosopher indulged himself in the most beastly pleasures, even in public: The saint refused himself the most innocent, even in private. The former thought it his duty to love his friends, and to rail at them, and reprove them, and scold them: The latter endeavoured to be abso<MPB ed="SBN" num="343"/>lutely indifferent towards his nearest relations, and to love and speak well of his enemies. The great object of <sc>Diogenes</sc>’s wit was every kind of superstition, that is every kind of religion known in his time. The mortality of the soul was his standard principle; and even his sentiments of a divine providence seem to have been licentious. The most ridiculous superstitions directed <sc>Pascal</sc>’s faith and practice; and an extreme contempt of this life, in <OPB num="398"/>comparison of the future, was the chief foundation of his conduct.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.56"><para>In such a remarkable contrast do these two men stand: Yet both of them have met with general admiration in their different ages, and have been proposed as models of imitation. Where then is the universal standard of morals, which you talk of? And what rule shall we establish for the many different, nay contrary sentiments of mankind?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M Dial.57"><para>An experiment, said I, which succeeds in the air, will not always succeed in a vacuum. When men depart from the maxims of common reason, and affect these <em>artificial</em> lives, as you call them, no one can answer to what will please or displease them. They are in a different element from the rest of mankind; and the natural principles of their mind play not with the same regularity, as if left to themselves, free from the illusions of religious superstition or philosophical enthusiasm.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="M [T].1"><para><ac><dc>T</dc>he</ac> author of <em>L’Esprit des Loix</em>. This illustrious writer, however, sets out with a different theory, and supposes all right to be founded on certain <em>rapports</em> or relations; which is a system, that, in my opinion, never will be reconciled with true philosophy. Father <sc>Malebranche</sc>, as far as I can learn, was the first that started this abstract theory of morals, which was afterwards adopted by <sc>Cudworth</sc>, <sc>Clarke</sc>, and others; and as it excludes all sentiment, and pretends to found every thing on reason, it has not wanted followers in <OPB num="488"/>this philosophic age. See Section I. Appendix I. With regard to justice, the virtue here treated of, the inference against this theory seems short and conclusive. Property is allowed to be dependent on civil laws; civil laws are allowed to have no other object, but the interest of society: This therefore must be allowed to be the sole foundation of property and justice. Not to mention, that our obligation itself to obey the magistrate and his laws is founded on nothing but the interests of society.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M [T].2"><para>If the ideas of justice, sometimes, do not follow the dispositions of civil law; we shall find, that these cases, instead of objections, are confirmations of the theory delivered above. Where a civil law is so perverse as to cross all the interests of society, it loses all its authority, and men judge by the ideas of natural justice, which are conformable to those interests. Sometimes also civil laws, for useful purposes, require a ceremony or form to any deed; and where that is wanting, their decrees run contrary to the usual tenour of justice; but one who takes advantage of such chicanes, is not commonly regarded as an honest man. Thus, the interests of society require, that contracts be fulfilled; and there is not a more material article either of natural or civil justice: But the omission of a trifling circumstance will often, by law, invalidate a contract, <em>in foro humano</em>, but not <em>in foro conscienti<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins></em>, as divines express themselves. In these cases, the magistrate is supposed only to withdraw his power of enforcing the right, not to have altered the right.

The expression being once brought in as subservient to the <OPB num="489"/>will, soon becomes the principal part of the promise; nor will a man be less bound by his word, though he secretly <MPB ed="SBN" num="200"/>give a different direction to his intention, and with-hold the assent of his mind. But though the expression makes, on most occasions, the whole of the promise, yet it does not always so; and one who should make use of any expression, of which he knows not the meaning, and which he uses without any sense of the consequences, would not certainly be bound by it. Nay, though he know its meaning, yet if he use it in jest only, and with such signs as evidently show, that he has no serious intention of binding himself, he would not lie under any obligation of performance; but it is necessary, that the words be a perfect expression of the will, without any contrary signs. Nay, even this we must not carry so far as to imagine, that one, whom, by our quickness of understanding, we conjecture, from certain signs, to have an intention of deceiving us, is not bound by his expression or verbal promise, if we accept of it; but must limit this conclusion to those cases where the signs are of a different nature from those of deceit. All these contradictions are easily accounted for, if justice arise entirely from its usefulness to society; but will never be explained on any other hypothesis.</para></dhot>

See his Dictionary, article <sc>Loyola</sc>. And why has the indignation of mankind risen so high against these casuists; but because every one perceived, that human society could not subsist were such practices authorized, and that morals must always be handled with a view to public interest, more than philosophical regularity? If the secret direction of the intention, said every man of sense, could invalidate a contract; where is our security? And yet a metaphysical schoolman might think, that, where an inten<OPB num="490"/>intention was supposed to be requisite, if that intention really had not place, no consequence ought to follow, and no obligation be imposed. The casuistical subtilties may not be greater than the subtilties of lawyers, hinted at above; but as the former are <em>pernicious</em>, and the latter <em>innocent</em> and even <em>necessary</em>, this is the reason of the very different reception they meet with from the world.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="M [RR].11"><para>In short, we must ever distinguish between the necessity of a separation and constancy in men’s possession, and the rules, which assign particular objects to particular persons. The first necessity is obvious, strong, and invincible: The latter may depend on a public utility more light and frivolous, on the sentiment of private humanity and aversion to private hardship, on positive laws, on precedents, analogies, and very fine connexions and turns of the imagination.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="M [TT].1"><para><ac><dc>L</dc>ove</ac> and esteem are nearly the same passion, and arise from similar causes. The qualities, which produce both, are such as communicate pleasure. But where this pleasure is severe and serious; or where its object is great, and makes a strong impression, or where it produces any degree of humility and awe: In all these cases, the passion, which arises from the pleasure, is more properly denominated esteem than love. Benevolence attends both: But is connected with love in a more eminent degree. There seems to be still a stronger mixture of pride in contempt than of humility in esteem; and <OPB num="502"/>the reason would not be difficult to one, who studied accurately the passions. All these various mixtures and compositions and appearances of sentiment form a very curious subject of speculation, but are wide of our present purpose. Throughout this enquiry, we always consider in general, what qualities are a subject of praise or of censure, without entering into all the minute differences of sentiment, which they excite. It is evident, that whatever is contemned, is also disliked, as well as what is hated; and we here endeavour to take objects, according to their most simple views and appearances. These sciences are but too apt to appear abstract to common readers, even with all the precautions which we can take to clear them from superfluous speculations, and bring them down to every capacity.</para></dhot>
