<dhot id="IPC 1"><para><ac><dc>I</dc>t</ac> is not with forms of government, as with other artificial contrivances; where an old engine may be rejected, if we can discover another more accurate and commodious, or where trials may safely be made, even though the success be doubtful. An established government has an infinite advantage, by that very circumstance of its being established; the bulk of mankind being governed by authority, not reason, and never attributing authority to any thing that has not the recommendation of antiquity. To tamper, therefore, in this affair, or try experiments merely upon the credit of supposed argument and philosophy, can never be the part of a wise magistrate, who will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age; and though he may attempt some improvements for the public <MPB ed="Mil" num="513"/>good, yet will he adjust his innovations, as much as possible, to the ancient fabric, and preserve entire the chief pillars and supports of the constitution.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 2"><para>The mathematicians in <sc>Europe</sc> have been much divided concerning that figure of a ship, which is the most commodious for sailing; and <sc>Huygens</sc>, who at last determined the controversy, is justly thought to have obliged the learned, as well as commercial world; though <sc>Columbus</sc> had sailed to <sc>America</sc>, and Sir <sc>Francis Drake</sc> made the tour of the world, without any such discovery. As one form of government must be allowed more perfect than another, independent of the manners and humours of particular men; why may we not enquire what is the most perfect of all, though the common botched and inaccurate governments seem to serve the purposes of society, and though it be not so easy to establish a new system of government, as to build a vessel upon a new construction? The subject is surely the most worthy curiosity of any the wit of man can possibly devise. And who knows, if this controversy were fixed by the universal consent of the wise and learned, but, in some future age, an opportunity might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice, either by a dissolution of some old government, or by the combination of men to form a new one, in some distant part of the world? In all cases, it must be advantageous to know what is most perfect in the kind, that we may be able to bring any real constitution or form of government as near it as possi<MPB ed="Mil" num="514"/>ble, by such gentle alterations and innovations as may not give too great disturbance to society.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 3"><para>All I pretend to in the present essay is to revive this subject of speculation; and therefore I shall deliver my sentiments in as few words as possible. A long dissertation on that head would not, I apprehend, be very acceptable to the public, who will be apt to regard such disquisitions both as useless and chimerical.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 4"><para>All plans of government, which suppose great reformation in the manners of mankind, are plainly imaginary. Of this nature, are the <em>Republic</em> of <sc>Plato</sc>, and the <em>Utopia</em> of Sir <sc>Thomas More</sc>. The <sc>Oceana</sc> is the only valuable model of a commonwealth, that has yet been offered to the public.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 5"><MPB ed="Mil" num="515"/><para>The chief defects of the <sc>Oceana</sc> seem to be these. <em>First</em>, Its rotation is inconvenient, by throwing men, of whatever abilities, by intervals, out of public employments. <em>Secondly</em>, Its <em>Agrarian</em> is impracticable. Men will soon learn the art, which was practised in ancient <sc>Rome</sc>, of concealing their possessions under other people’s name; till at last, the abuse will become so common, that they will throw off even the appearance of restraint. <em>Thirdly</em>, The <sc>Oceana</sc> provides not a sufficient security for liberty, or the redress of grievances. The senate must propose, and the people consent; by which means, the senate have not only a negative upon the people, but, what is of much greater consequence, their negative goes before the votes of the people. Were the King’s negative of the same nature in the <sc>English</sc> constitution, and could he prevent any bill from coming into parliament, he would be an absolute monarch. As his negative follows the votes of the houses, it is of little consequence: Such a difference is there in the manner of placing the same thing. When a popular bill has been debated in parliament, is brought to maturity, all its conveniencies and inconveniencies, weighed and balanced; if afterwards it be presented for the royal assent, few princes will venture to reject the unanimous desire of the people. But could the King crush a disagreeable bill in embryo (as was the case, for some time, in the <sc>Scottish</sc> parliament, by means of the lords of the articles), the <sc>British</sc> government would have no balance, nor would grievances ever be redressed: And it is certain, that exorbitant power proceeds not, in any govern<MPB ed="Mil" num="516"/>ment, from new laws, so much as from neglecting to remedy the abuses, which frequently rise from the old ones. A government, says <sc>Machiavel</sc>, must often be brought back to its original principles. It appears then, that, in the <sc>Oceana</sc>, the whole legislature may be said to rest in the senate; which <sc>Harrington</sc> would own to be an inconvenient form of government, especially after the <em>Agrarian</em> is abolished.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="IPC 48"><para>The lower sort of people and small proprietors are good judges enough of one not very distant from them in rank or habitation; and therefore, in their parochial meetings, will probably chuse the best, or nearly the best representative: But they are wholly unfit for county-meetings, and for electing into the higher offices of the republic. Their ignorance gives the grandees an opportunity of deceiving them.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 49"><para>Ten thousand, even though they were not annually elected, are a basis large enough for any free government. It is true, the nobles in <sc>Poland</sc> are more than 10,000, and yet these oppress the people. But as power always continues there in the same persons and families, this makes them, in a manner, a different nation from the people. Besides the nobles are there united under a few heads of families.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 50"><para>All free governments must consist of two councils, a lesser and greater; or, in other words, of a senate and people. The <MPB ed="Mil" num="523"/>people, as <sc>Harrington</sc> observes, would want wisdom, without the senate: The senate, without the people, would want honesty.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 51"><para>A large assembly of 1000, for instance, to represent the people, if allowed to debate, would fall into disorder. If not allowed to debate, the senate has a negative upon them, and the worst kind of negative, that before resolution.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 52"><para>Here therefore is an inconvenience, which no government has yet fully remedied, but which is the easiest to be remedied in the world. If the people debate, all is confusion: If they do not debate, they can only resolve; and then the senate carves for them. Divide the people into many separate bodies; and then they may debate with safety, and every inconvenience seems to be prevented.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 53"><para>Cardinal de <sc>Retz</sc> says, that all numerous assemblies, however composed, are mere mob, and swayed in their debates by the least motive. This we find confirmed by daily experience. When an absurdity strikes a member, he conveys it to his neighbour, and so on, till the whole be infected. Separate this great body; and though every member be only of middling sense, it is not probable, that any thing but reason can prevail over the whole. Influence and example being removed, good sense will always get the better of bad among a number of people.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 54"><para>There are two things to be guarded against in every <em>senate:</em> Its combination, and its division. Its combination is most dangerous. And against this inconvenience we have provided the following remedies. 1. The great dependence of the senators on the people by annual elections; and that not by an un<MPB ed="Mil" num="524"/>distinguishing rabble, like the <sc>English</sc> electors, but by men of fortune and education. 2. The small power they are allowed. They have few offices to dispose of. Almost all are given by the magistrates in the counties. 3. The court of competitors, which being composed of men that are their rivals, next to them in interest, and uneasy in their present situation, will be sure to take all advantages against them.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 55"><para>The division of the senate is prevented, 1. By the smallness of their number. 2. As faction supposes a combination in a separate interest, it is prevented by their dependence on the people. 3. They have a power of expelling any factious member. It is true, when another member of the same spirit comes from the county, they have no power of expelling him: Nor is it fit they should; for that shows the humour to be in the people, and may possibly arise from some ill conduct in public affairs. 4. Almost any man, in a senate so regularly chosen by the people, may be supposed fit for any civil office. It would be proper, therefore, for the senate to form some <em>general</em> resolutions with regard to the disposing of offices among the members: Which resolutions would not confine them in critical times, when extraordinary parts on the one hand, or extraordinary stupidity on the other, appears in any senator; but they would be sufficient to prevent intrigue and faction, by making the disposal of the offices a thing of course. For instance, let it be a resolution, That no man shall enjoy any office, till he has sat four years in the senate: That, except ambassadors, no man shall be in office two years following: That no man shall attain the higher offices but through the lower: That no man shall be protector twice, &amp;c. The senate of <sc>Venice</sc> govern themselves by such resolutions.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 56"><para>In foreign politics the interest of the senate can scarcely ever be divided from that of the people; and therefore it is fit to make the senate absolute with regard to them; otherwise there could be no secrecy or refined policy. Besides, without money no alliance can be executed; and the senate is still sufficiently dependant. Not to mention, that the legislative power being always superior to the executive, the magistrates or representatives may interpose whenever they think proper.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 57"><MPB ed="Mil" num="525"/><para>The chief support of the <sc>British</sc> government is the opposition of interests; but that, though in the main serviceable, breeds endless factions. In the foregoing plan, it does all the good without any of the harm. The <em>competitors</em> have no power of controlling the senate: They have only the power of accusing, and appealing to the people.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 58"><para>It is necessary, likewise, to prevent both combination and division in the thousand magistrates. This is done sufficiently by the separation of places and interests.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 59"><para>But lest that should not be sufficient, their dependence on the 10,000 for their elections, serves to the same purpose.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 60"><para>Nor is that all: For the 10,000 may resume the power whenever they please; and not only when they all please, but when any five of a hundred please, which will happen upon the very first suspicion of a separate interest.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 61"><para>The 10,000 are too large a body either to unite or divide, except when they meet in one place, and fall under the guidance of ambitious leaders. Not to mention their annual election, by the whole body of the people, that are of any consideration.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 62"><para>A small commonwealth is the happiest government in the world within itself, because every thing lies under the eye of the rulers: But it may be subdued by great force from without. This scheme seems to have all the advantages both of a great and a little commonwealth.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 63"><para>Every county-law may be annulled either by the senate or another county; because that shows an opposition of interest: In which case no part ought to decide for itself. The matter must be referred to the whole, which will best determine what agrees with general interest.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 64"><para>As to the clergy and militia, the reasons of these orders are obvious. Without the dependence of the clergy on the civil magistrates, and without a militia, it is in vain to think that any free government will ever have security or stability.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 65"><para>In many governments, the inferior magistrates have no rewards but what arise from their ambition, vanity, or public spirit. The salaries of the <sc>French</sc> judges amount not to the interest of the sums they pay for their offices. The <sc>Dutch</sc> <MPB ed="Mil" num="526"/>burgo-masters have little more immediate profit than the <sc>English</sc> justices of peace, or the members of the house of commons formerly. But lest any should suspect, that this would beget negligence in the administration (which is little to be feared, considering the natural ambition of mankind), let the magistrates have competent salaries. The senators have access to so many honourable and lucrative offices, that their attendance needs not be bought. There is little attendance required of the representatives.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 66"><para>That the foregoing plan of government is practicable, no one can doubt, who considers the resemblance that it bears to the commonwealth of the United Provinces, a wise and renowned government. The alterations in the present scheme seem all evidently for the better. 1. The representation is more equal. 2. The unlimited power of the burgo-masters in the towns, which forms a perfect aristocracy in the <sc>Dutch</sc> commonwealth, is corrected by a well-tempered democracy, in giving to the people the annual election of the county representatives. 3. The negative, which every province and town has upon the whole body of the <sc>Dutch</sc> republic, with regard to alliances, peace and war, and the imposition of taxes, is here removed. 4. The counties, in the present plan, are not so independent of each other, nor do they form separate bodies so much as the seven provinces; where the jealousy and envy of the smaller provinces and towns against the greater, particularly <sc>Holland</sc> and <sc>Amsterdam</sc>, have frequently disturbed the government. 5. Larger powers, though of the safest kind, are intrusted to the senate than the States-General possess; by which means, the former may become more expeditious, and secret in their resolutions, than it is possible for the latter.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 67"><para>The chief alterations that could be made on the <sc>British</sc> government, in order to bring it to the most perfect model of limited monarchy, seem to be the following. <em>First</em>, The plan of <sc>Cromwell</sc>’s parliament ought to be restored, by making the representation equal, and by allowing none to vote in the county elections who possess not a property of 200 pounds <MPB ed="Mil" num="527"/>value. <em>Secondly</em>, As such a house of Commons would be too weighty for a frail house of Lords, like the present, the Bishops and <sc>Scotch</sc> Peers ought to be removed: The number of the upper house ought to be raised to three or four hundred: Their seats not hereditary, but during life: They ought to have the election of their own members; and no commoner should be allowed to refuse a seat that was offered him. By this means the house of Lords would consist entirely of the men of chief credit, abilities, and interest in the nation; and every turbulent leader in the house of Commons might be taken off, and connected by interest with the house of Peers. Such an aristocracy would be an excellent barrier both to the monarchy and against it. At present, the balance of our government depends in some measure on the abilities and behaviour of the sovereign; which are variable and uncertain circumstances.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 68"><para>This plan of limited monarchy, however corrected, seems still liable to three great inconveniencies. <em>First</em>, It removes not entirely, though it may soften, the parties of <em>court</em> and <em>country. Secondly</em>, The king’s personal character must still have great influence on the government. <em>Thirdly</em>, The sword is in the hands of a single person, who will always neglect to discipline the militia, in order to have a pretence for keeping up a standing army.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 69"><para>We shall conclude this subject, with observing the falsehood of the common opinion, that no large state, such as <sc>France</sc> or <sc>Great Britain</sc>, could ever be modelled into a commonwealth, but that such a form of government can only take place in a city or small territory. The contrary seems probable. Though it is more difficult to form a republican government in an extensive country than in a city; there is more facility, when once it is formed, of preserving it steady and uniform, without tumult and faction. It is not easy, for the distant parts of a large state to combine in any plan of free government; but they easily conspire in the esteem and reverence for a single person, who, by means of this popular favour, may seize the power, and forcing the more obstinate to submit, may establish a monarchical government. On the other <MPB ed="Mil" num="528"/>hand, a city readily concurs in the same notions of government, the natural equality of property favours liberty, and the nearness of habitation enables the citizens mutually to assist each other. Even under absolute princes, the subordinate government of cities is commonly republican; while that of counties and provinces is monarchical. But these same circumstances, which facilitate the erection of commonwealths in cities, render their constitution more frail and uncertain. Democracies are turbulent. For however the people may be separated or divided into small parties, either in their votes or elections; their near habitation in a city will always make the force of popular tides and currents very sensible. Aristocracies are better adapted for peace and order, and accordingly were most admired by ancient writers; but they are jealous and oppressive. In a large government, which is modelled with masterly skill, there is compass and room enough to refine the democracy, from the lower people, who may be admitted into the first elections or first concoction of the commonwealth, to the higher magistrates, who direct all the movements. At the same time, the parts are so distant and remote, that it is very difficult, either by intrigue, prejudice, or passion, to hurry them into any measures against the public interest.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="IPC 70"><para>It is needless to enquire, whether such a government would be immortal. I allow the justness of the poet’s exclamation on the endless projects of human race, <em>Man and for ever!</em> The world itself probably is not immortal. Such consuming plagues may arise as would leave even a perfect government a weak prey to its neighbours. We know not to what length <MPB ed="Mil" num="529"/>enthusiasm, or other extraordinary movements of the human mind, may transport men, to the neglect of all order and public good. Where difference of interest is removed, whimsical and unaccountable factions often arise, from personal favour or enmity. Perhaps, rust may grow to the springs of the most accurate political machine, and disorder its motions. Lastly, extensive conquests, when pursued, must be the ruin of every free government; and of the more perfect governments sooner than of the imperfect; because of the very advantages which the former possess above the latter. And though such a state ought to establish a fundamental law against conquests; yet republics have ambition as well as individuals, and present interest makes men forgetful of their posterity. It is a sufficient incitement to human endeavours, that such a government would flourish for many ages; without pretending to bestow, on any work of man, that immortality, which the Almighty seems to have refused to his own productions.</para></dhot>
