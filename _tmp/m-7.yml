<dhot id="M 7.1"><para><ac><dc>W</dc>hoever</ac> has passed an evening with serious melancholy people, and has observed how suddenly the conversation was animated, and what sprightliness diffused itself over the countenance, discourse, and behaviour of every one, on the accession of a good-humoured, lively companion; such a one will easily allow, that <ac>chearfulness</ac> carries great merit with it, and naturally conciliates the good-will of mankind. No quality, indeed, more readily communicates itself to all around; because no one has a greater propensity to display itself, in jovial talk and pleasant entertainment. The flame spreads through the whole circle; and the most sullen and morose are often caught by it. That the melancholy hate the merry, even though <sc>Horace</sc> says it, I have some difficulty to allow; because I have always observed, that, where the jollity is moderate and decent, serious people are so much the more delighted, as it dissipates the gloom, with which they are commonly oppressed; and gives them an unusual enjoyment.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.2"><para>From this influence of chearfulness, both to communicate itself, and to engage approbation, we may perceive, that there is another set of mental qualities, which, without any utility or any tendency to farther good, <OPB num="300"/>either of the community or of the possessor, diffuse a satisfaction on the beholders, and procure friendship and regard. Their imme<MPB ed="SBN" num="251"/>diate sensation, to the person possessed of them, is agreeable: Others enter into the same humour, and catch the sentiment, by a contagion or natural sympathy: And as we cannot forbear loving whatever pleases, a kindly emotion arises towards the person, who communicates so much satisfaction. He is a more animating spectacle: His presence diffuses over us more serene complacency and enjoyment: Our imagination, entering into his feelings and disposition, is affected in a more agreeable manner, than if a melancholy, dejected, sullen, anxious temper were presented to us. Hence the affection and approbation, which attend the former: The aversion and disgust, with which we regard the latter<footnote num="35" sym="*"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.3"><para>Few men would envy the character, which <sc>C<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>sar</sc> gives of <sc>Cassius</sc>. <blockquote><tab/><tab/><tab/><tab/><tab/>He loves no play, <br/>As thou do’st, <sc>Anthony</sc>: He hears no music: <br/>Seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort, <br/>As if he mock’d himself, and scorn’d his spirit <br/>That could be mov’d to smile at any thing.</blockquote> Not only such men, as <sc>C<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>sar</sc> adds, are commonly <em>dangerous</em>, but also, having little enjoyment within themselves, they can never become agreeable to others, or contribute to social entertainment. In all polite nations and ages, a relish for pleasure, if accompanied with temperance and decency, is esteemed a considerable merit, even in the greatest men; and becomes still more requisite in those of inferior rank and character. It is an agreeable representation, which a <sc>French</sc> writer gives <OPB num="301"/>of the situation of his own mind in this particular, <MPB ed="SBN" num="252"/><em>Virtue I love</em>, says he, <em>without austerity: Pleasure without effeminacy: And life, without fearing its end</em><footnote num="36" sym="*"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.4"><para>Who is not struck with any signal instance of <ac>greatness</ac> of <ac>mind</ac> or Dignity of Character; with elevation of sentiment, disdain of slavery, and with that noble pride and spirit, which arises from conscious virtue? The sublime, says <sc>Longinus</sc>, is often nothing but the echo or image of magnanimity; and where this quality appears in any one, even though a syllable be not uttered, it excites our applause and admiration; as may be observed of the famous silence of <sc>Ajax</sc> in the <sc>Odyssey</sc>, which expresses more noble disdain and resolute indignation, than any language can convey<footnote num="37" sym="†"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.5"><para><em>Were I</em> <sc>Alexander</sc>, said <sc>Parmenio</sc>, <em>I would accept of these offers made by</em> <sc>Darius</sc>. <em>So would I too</em>, replied <sc>Alexander</sc>, <em>were I</em> <sc>Parmenio</sc>. This saying is admirable, says <sc>Longinus</sc>, from a like principle<footnote num="38" sym="‡"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.6"><para><em>Go!</em> cries the same hero to his soldiers, when they refused to follow him to the <sc>Indies</sc>, <em>go tell your countrymen, that you left</em> <sc>Alexander</sc> <em>compleating the conquest of the world</em>. “<sc>Alexander</sc>,” said the Prince of <sc>Condé</sc>, who always admired this passage, “abandoned by his soldiers, among Barbarians, not yet fully subdued, felt in himself such a dignity and right of empire, that he could not believe it possible, that any one would refuse to obey him. Whether in <sc>Europe</sc> or in <sc>Asia</sc>, among <sc>Greeks</sc> or <sc>Persians</sc>, all was indifferent to him: Wherever he found men, he fancied he should find subjects.”</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.7"><para>The confident of <sc>Medea</sc> in the tragedy recommends caution and submission; and enumerating all the distresses of that unfortunate heroine, asks her, what she has to support her against her numerous and implacable enemies. <em>Myself</em>, <MPB ed="SBN" num="253"/>replies she; <em>Myself I say, and it is enough</em>. <sc>Boileau</sc> justly recommends this passage as an instance of true sublime<footnote num="39" sym="*"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.8"><para>When <sc>Phocion</sc>, the modest, the gentle <sc>Phocion</sc>, was led to execution, he turned to one of his fellow-sufferers, who was lamenting his own hard fate. <em>Is it not glory enough for you</em>, says he, <em>that you die with</em> <sc>Phocion</sc><footnote num="40" sym="†"/>?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.9"><para>Place in opposition the picture, which <sc>Tacitus</sc> draws of <sc>Vitellius</sc>, fallen from empire, prolonging his ignominy from a wretched love of life, delivered over to the merciless rabble; tossed, buffeted, and kicked about; constrained, by their holding a poinard under his chin, to raise his head, and expose himself to every contumely. What abject infamy! What low humiliation! Yet even here, says the historian, he discovered some symptoms of a mind not wholly degenerate. To <del>at ribune</del><ins comment="originally 'at ribune'; obviously an error, and the 1772 edition has 'a tribune' as expected">a tribune</ins>, who insulted him, he replied, <em>I am still your emperor</em><footnote num="41" sym="‡"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.10"><para>We never excuse the absolute want of spirit and dignity of character, or a proper sense of what is due to one’s self, in society and the common intercourse of life. This vice constitutes what we properly call <em>meanness</em>; when a man can submit to the basest slavery, in order to gain his ends; fawn upon those who abuse him; and degrade himself by intimacies and familiarities with undeserving inferiors. A certain degree of generous pride or self-value is so requisite, that the absence of it in the mind <OPB num="303"/>displeases, after the same manner as the want of a nose, eye, or any of the most material feature of the face or member of the body<footnote num="42" sym="*"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.11"><MPB ed="SBN" num="254"/><para>The utility of <ac>courage</ac>, both to the public and to the person possessed of it, is an obvious foundation of merit: But to any one who duly considers of the matter, it will appear, that this quality has a peculiar lustre, which it derives wholly from itself, and from that noble elevation inseparable from it. Its figure, drawn by painters and by poets, displays, in each feature, a sublimity and daring confidence; which catches the eye, engages the affections, and diffuses, by sympathy, a like sublimity of sentiment over every spectator.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.12"><para>Under what shining colours does <sc>Demosthenes</sc><footnote num="43" sym="†"/> represent <sc>Philip</sc>; where the orator apologizes for his own administration, and justifies that pertinacious love of liberty, with which he had inspired the <sc>Athenians</sc>. “I beheld <sc>Philip</sc>,” says he, “he with whom was your contest, resolutely, while in pursuit of empire and dominion, exposing himself to every wound; his eye goared, his neck wrested, his arm, his thigh pierced, whatever part of his body fortune should seize on, that cheerfully relinquishing; provided that, with what remained, he might live in honour and renown. And shall it be said, that he, born in <sc>Pella</sc>, a place heretofore mean and ignoble, should be inspired with so high an ambition and thirst of fame: While you, <sc>Athenians</sc>, <em>&amp;c.</em>” These praises excite the most lively admiration; but the views presented by the orator, carry us not, we see, beyond the hero himself, nor ever regard the future advantageous consequences of his valour.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.13"><para>The martial temper of the <sc>Romans</sc>, inflamed by continual wars, had raised their esteem of courage so high, that, in <MPB ed="SBN" num="255"/>their language, it was called <em>virtue</em>, by way of excellence and of distinction from all other moral qualities. <em>The</em> <sc>Suevi</sc>, in the opinion of <sc>Tacitus</sc><footnote num="44" sym="†"/>, <em>dressed their hair with a laudable intent: Not for the purpose of loving or being loved: They dorned themselves only for their enemies, and in order to appear more terrible</em>. A sentiment of the historian, which would sound a little oddly in other nations and other ages.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.14"><para>The <sc>Scythians</sc>, according to <sc>Herodotus</sc><footnote num="45" sym="‡"/>, after scalping their enemies, dressed the skin like leather, and used it as a towel; and whoever had the most of those towels was most esteemed among them. So much had martial bravery, in that nation, as well as in many others, destroyed the sentiments of humanity; a virtue surely much more useful and engaging.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.15"><para>It is indeed observable, that, among all uncultivated nations, who have not, as yet, had full experience of the advantages attending beneficence, justice, and the social virtues, courage is the predominant excellence; what is most celebrated by poets, recommended by parents and instructors, and admired by the public in general. The ethics of <sc>Homer</sc> are, in this particular, very different from those of <sc>Fenelon</sc>, his elegant imitator; and such as were well suited to an age, when one hero, as remarked by <sc>Thucydides</sc><footnote num="46" sym="ǁ"/>, could ask another, without offence, whether he were a robber or not. Such also, very lately, was the system of ethics, which prevailed in many barbarous parts of <sc>Ireland</sc>; if we <OPB num="305"/>may credit <sc>Spencer</sc>, in his judicious account of the state of that kingdom<footnote num="47" sym="†"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.16"><MPB ed="SBN" num="256"/><para>Of the same class of virtues with courage is that undisturbed philosophical <ac>tranquillity</ac>, superior to pain, sorrow, anxiety, and each assault of adverse fortune. Conscious of his own virtue, say the philosophers, the sage elevates himself above every accident of life; and securely placed in the temple of wisdom, looks down on inferior mortals, engaged in pursuit of honours, riches, reputation, and every frivolous enjoyment. These pretensions, no doubt, when stretched to the utmost, are, by far, too magnificent for human nature. They carry, however, a grandeur with them, which seizes the spectator, and strikes him with admiration. And the nearer we can approach in practice, to this sublime tranquillity and indifference (for we must distinguish it from a stupid insensibility) the more secure enjoyment shall we attain within ourselves, and the more greatness of mind shall we discover to the world. The philosophical tranquillity may, indeed, be considered only as a branch of magnanimity.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.17"><para>Who admires not <sc>Socrates</sc>; his perpetual serenity and contentment, amidst the greatest poverty and domestic vexations; his resolute contempt of riches, and his magnanimous care of preserving liberty, while he refused all assistance from his friends and disciples, and avoided even the dependence of an obligation? <sc>Epictetus</sc> had not so much as a door to his little house or hovel; and there<OPB num="306"/>fore, soon lost his iron lamp, the only furniture which he had worth taking. But resolving to disappoint all robbers for the future, he supplied its place with an earthen lamp, of which he very peaceably kept possession ever after.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.18"><para>Among the ancients, the heroes in philosophy, as well as those in war and patriotism, have a grandeur and force of sentiment, which astonishes our narrow souls, and is rashly rejected as extravagant and supernatural. They, in their turn, I allow, would have had equal reason to consider as romantic and incredible, the degree of humanity, clemency, <MPB ed="SBN" num="257"/>order, tranquillity, and other social virtues, to which, in the administration of government, we have attained in modern times, had any one been then able to have made a fair representation of them. Such is the compensation, which nature, or rather education, has made in the distribution of excellencies and virtues, in those different ages.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.19"><para>The merit of <ac>benevolence</ac>, arising from its utility, and its tendency to promote the good of mankind, has been already explained, and is, no doubt, the source of a <em>considerable</em> part of that esteem, which is so universally paid to it. But it will also be allowed, that the very softness and tenderness of the sentiment, its engaging endearments, its fond expressions, its delicate attentions, and all that flow of mutual confidence and regard, which enters into a warm attachment of love and friendship: It will be allowed, I say, that these feelings, being delightful in themselves, are necessarily communicated to the spectators, and melt them into the same fondness and delicacy. The tear naturally starts in our eye on the apprehension of a warm sentiment of this nature: Our breast heaves, our heart is agitated, and every humane tender principle of our frame is set in motion, <OPB num="307"/>and gives us the purest and most satisfactory enjoyment.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.20"><para>When poets form descriptions of <sc>Elysian</sc> fields, where the blessed inhabitants stand in no need of each other’s assistance, they yet represent them as maintaining a constant intercourse of love and friendship, and sooth our fancy with the pleasing image of these soft and gentle passions. The idea of tender tranquillity in a pastoral <sc>Arcadia</sc> is agreeable from a like principle, as has been observed above<footnote num="48" sym="*"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.21"><para>Who would live amidst perpetual wrangling, and scolding, and mutual reproaches? The roughness and harshness of these emotions disturb and displease us: We suffer by <MPB ed="SBN" num="258"/>contagion and sympathy; nor can we remain indifferent spectators, even though certain, that no pernicious consequences would ever follow from such angry passions.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.22"><para>As a certain proof, that the whole merit of benevolence is not derived from its usefulness, we may observe, that, in a kind way of blame, we say, a person is <em>too good</em>; when he exceeds his part in society, and carries his attention for others beyond the proper bounds. In like manner, we say, a man is <em>too high-spirited, too intrepid, too indifferent about fortune:</em> Reproaches, which really, at bottom, imply more esteem than many panegyrics. Being accustomed to rate the merit and demerit of characters chiefly by their useful or pernicious tendencies, we cannot forbear applying the epithet of blame, when we discover a sentiment, which rises to a degree, that is hurtful: But it may happen, at the same time, that its noble elevation, or its engaging tenderness so seizes the <OPB num="308"/>heart, as rather to encrease our friendship and concern for the person<footnote num="49" sym="†"/>.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.23"><para>The amours and attachments of <sc>Harry</sc> the IVth of <sc>France</sc>, during the civil wars of the league, frequently hurt his interest and his cause; but all the young, at least, and amorous, who can sympathize with the tender passions, will allow, that this very weakness (for they will readily call it such) chiefly endears that hero, and interests them in his fortunes.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.24"><para>The excessive bravery and resolute inflexibility of <sc>Charles</sc> the XIIth ruined his own country, and infested all his neighbours; but have such splendour and greatness in their appearance, as strikes us with admiration; and they might, in some degree, be even approved of, if they betrayed not sometimes too evident symptoms of madness and disorder.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.25"><MPB ed="SBN" num="259"/><para>The <sc>Athenians</sc> pretended to the first invention of agriculture and of laws; and always valued themselves extremely on the benefit thereby procured to the whole race of mankind. They also boasted, and with reason, of their warlike enterprizes; particularly against those innumerable fleets and armies of <sc>Persians</sc>, which invaded <sc>Greece</sc> during the reigns of <sc>Darius</sc> and <sc>Xerxes</sc>. But though there be no comparison, in point of utility, between these peaceful and military honours; yet we find, that the orators, who have writ such elaborate panegyrics on that famous city, have chiefly triumphed in displaying the warlike atchievements. <sc>Lysias</sc>, <sc>Thucydides</sc>, <sc>Plato</sc>, and <sc>Isocrates</sc> discover, all of them, the same partiality; which, though con<OPB num="309"/>demned by calm reason and reflection, appears so <del>natura</del><ins comment="originally 'natura'; obviously an error, and the 1772 edition agrees">natural</ins> in the mind of man.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.26"><para>It is observable, that the great charm of poetry consists in lively pictures of the sublime passions, magnanimity, courage, disdain of fortune; or those of the tender affections, love and friendship; which warm the heart, and diffuse over it similar sentiments and emotions. And though all kinds of passion, even the most disagreeable, such as grief and anger, are observed, when excited by poetry, to convey a satisfaction, from a mechanism of nature, not easy to be explained: Yet those more elevated or softer affections have a peculiar influence, and please from more than one cause or principle. Not to mention, that they alone interest us in the fortune of the persons represented, or communicate any esteem and affection for their character.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.27"><para>And can it possibly be doubted, that this talent itself of poets, to move the passions, this <ac>pathetic</ac> and <ac>sublime</ac> of sentiment, is a very considerable merit; and being enhanced by its extreme rarity, may exalt the person possessed of it, above every character of the age in which he lives? The prudence, address, steadiness, and benign government of <sc>Augustus</sc>, adorned with all the splendour of his noble birth and imperial crown, render him but an unequal competitor <MPB ed="SBN" num="260"/>for fame with <sc>Virgil</sc>, who lays nothing into the opposite scale but the divine beauties of his poetical genius.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.28"><para>The very sensibility to these beauties, or a <ac>delicacy</ac> of taste, is itself a beauty in any character; as conveying the purest, the most durable, and most innocent of all enjoyments.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="M 7.29"><para>These are some instances of the several species of merit, that are valued for the immediate pleasure, which they communicate to the person possessed of them. No views <OPB num="310"/>of utility or of future beneficial consequences enter into this sentiment of approbation; yet is it of a kind similar to that other sentiment, which arises from views of a public or private utility. The same social sympathy, we may observe, or fellow-feeling with human happiness or misery, gives rise to both; and this analogy, in all the parts of the present theory, may justly be regarded as a confirmation of it.</para></dhot>
