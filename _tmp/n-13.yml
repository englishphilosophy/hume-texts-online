<dhot id="N 13"><MPB ed="Bea" num="77"/><title><h1><sc>Sect. XIII.</sc> <em>Impious conceptions of the divine nature in popular religions of both kinds.</em></h1></title></dhot>
<dhot id="N 13.1"><para>The primary religion of mankind arises chiefly from an anxious fear of future events; and what ideas will naturally be entertained of invisible, unknown powers, while men lie under dismal apprehensions of any kind, may easily be conceived. Every image of vengeance, severity, cruelty, and malice must occur, and must augment the ghastliness and horror, which oppresses the amazed religionist. A panic having once seized the mind, the active fancy still farther multiplies the objects of terror; while that profound darkness, or, what is worse, that glimmering light, with which we are environed, represents the spectres of divinity under the most dreadful appearances imaginable. And no idea of perverse wickedness can be framed, which those terrified devotees do not readily, without scruple, apply to their deity.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 13.2"><para>This appears the natural state of religion, when surveyed in one light. But if we consider, on the other hand, that spirit of praise and eulogy, which necessarily has place in all religions, and which is the consequence of these very terrors, we must expect a quite contrary system of theology to prevail. Every virtue, every excellence, must be ascribed to the divinity, and no ex<OPB num="458"/>aggeration will be deemed sufficient to reach those perfections, with which he is endowed. Whatever strains of panegyric can be invented, are immediately embraced, without consulting any arguments or ph<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>nomena: It is esteemed a sufficient confirmation of them, that they give us more magnificent ideas of the divine objects of our worship and adoration.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 13.3"><para>Here therefore is a kind of contradiction between the different principles of human nature, which enter into religion. Our natural terrors present the notion of a devilish and malicious deity: Our propensity to adulation leads us to acknowledge an excellent and divine. And the influence of these opposite principles are various, according to the different situation of the human understanding.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 13.4"><para>In very barbarous and ignorant nations, such as the <sc>Africans</sc> and <sc>Indians</sc>, nay even the <sc>Japonese</sc>, who can form no extensive ideas of power and knowledge, worship may be paid to a being, whom they confess to be wicked and detestable; though they may be cautious, perhaps, of pronouncing this <MPB ed="Bea" num="78"/>judgment of him in public, or in his temple, where he may be supposed to hear their reproaches.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 13.5"><para>Such rude, imperfect ideas of the Divinity adhere long to all idolaters; and it may safely be affirmed, that the <sc>Greeks</sc> themselves never got entirely rid of them. It is remarked by <sc>Xenophon</sc><footnote num="83" sym="*"/>, in praise of <sc>Socrates</sc>, that this philosopher assented not to the vulgar opinion, which supposed the gods to know some things, and be ignorant of others: He maintained, that they knew every thing; what was done, said, or even thought. <OPB num="459"/>But as this was a strain of philosophy<footnote num="84" sym="†"/> much above the conception of his countrymen, we need not be surprised, if very frankly, in their books and conversation, they blamed the deities, whom they worshipped in their temples. It is observable, that <sc>Herodotus</sc> in particular scruples not, in many passages, to ascribe <em>envy</em> to the gods; a sentiment, of all others, the most suitable to a mean and devilish nature. The pagan hymns, however, sung in public worship, contained nothing but epithets of praise; even while the actions ascribed to the gods were the most barbarous and detestable. When <sc>Timotheus</sc>, the poet, recited a hymn to <sc>Diana</sc>, in which he enumerated, with the greatest eulogies, all the actions and attributes of that cruel, capricious goddess: <em>May your daughter,</em> said one present, <em>become such as the deity whom you celebrate<footnote num="85" sym="*"/>.</em></para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 13.6"><para>But as men farther exalt their idea of their divinity; it is their notion of his power and knowledge only, not of his goodness, which is improved. On the contrary, in proportion to the supposed extent of his science and authority, their terrors naturally augment; while they believe, that no secrecy can conceal them from his scrutiny, and that even the inmost recesses of their breast lie open before him. They must then be careful not to form expressly any sentiment of blame and disapprobation. All must be applause, ravishment, extacy. And while their gloomy apprehensions make them ascribe to him measures of conduct, which, in human creatures, would be highly blamed, they must still affect to praise and ad<OPB num="460"/>mire that conduct in the object of their devotional addresses. Thus it may safely be affirmed, that popular religions are really, in the conception of their more vulgar votaries, a species of d<del>æ</del><ins comment="originally 'æ'; separated to make searching the text easier">ae</ins>monism; and the higher the deity is exalted in power and knowledge, the lower of course is he depressed in goodness and benevolence; whatever epithets of praise may be bestowed on him by <MPB ed="Bea" num="79"/>his amazed adorers. Among idolaters, the words may be false, and belie the secret opinion: But among more exalted religionists, the opinion itself contracts a kind of falsehood, and belies the inward sentiment. The heart secretly detests such measures of cruel and implacable vengeance; but the judgment dares not but pronounce them perfect and adorable. And the additional misery of this inward struggle aggravates all the other terrors, by which these unhappy victims to superstition are for ever haunted.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="N 13.7"><para><sc>Lucian</sc><footnote num="86" sym="*"/> observes that a young man, who reads the history of the gods in <sc>Homer</sc> or <sc>Hesiod</sc>, and finds their factions, wars, injustice, incest, adultery, and other immoralities so highly celebrated, is much surprised afterwards, when he comes into the world, to observe that punishments are by law inflicted on the same actions, which he had been taught to ascribe to superior beings. The contradiction is still perhaps stronger between the representations given us by some later religions and our natural ideas of generosity, lenity, impartiality, and justice; and in proportion to the multiplied terrors of these religions, the barbarous conceptions of the divinity are multiplied upon us<footnote num="87" sym="†"/>. Nothing can preserve untainted the <MPB ed="Bea" num="80"/>genuine principles of morals in our judgment of human conduct, but the absolute necessity of these principles to the existence of society. If common conception <OPB num="461"/>can indulge princes in a system of ethics, somewhat different from that which should regulate private persons; how much more those superior beings, whose attributes, views, and nature are so totally unknown to us? <em>Sunt superis sua jura<footnote num="88" sym="*"/>.</em> The gods have maxims of justice peculiar to themselves.</para></dhot>
