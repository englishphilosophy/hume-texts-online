<dhot id="Su 1"><para><ac><dc>O</dc>ne</ac> considerable advantage, that arises from philosophy, consists in the sovereign antidote, which it affords to superstition and false religion. All other remedies against that pestilent distemper are vain, or, at least, uncertain. Plain good-<MPB ed="Mil" num="578"/>sense, and the practice of the world, which alone serve most purposes of life, are here found ineffectual: History, as well as daily experience, <del>furnishes</del><ins comment="originally 'furnishes'; written change in Hume's hand">affords</ins> instances of men, endowed <OPB num="2"/>with the strongest capacity for business and affairs, who have all their lives crouched under slavery to the grossest superstition. Even gaiety and sweetness of temper, which infuse a balm into every other wound, afford no remedy to so virulent a poison; <MPB ed="Mil" num="579"/>as we may particularly observe of the fair sex, who, tho’ commonly <del>possess</del><ins comment="originally 'possess' (I am fairly sure, although it is not clearly legible); written change in Hume's hand">possessed</ins> of these rich presents of nature, feel many of their joys blasted by this importunate intruder. But when sound philosophy has once gained possession of the mind, superstition is effectually excluded; and one may safely affirm, that her <OPB ed="five dissertations" num="204"/>triumph over this enemy is more compleat than over most of the vices and imperfections, incident to human nature. Love or anger, ambition or avarice, have their root in the temper and affections, which the soundest reason is scarce ever able fully to correct. But superstition, being founded on false opinion, must immediately vanish, when true philosophy has inspired juster sentiments of superior powers. <OPB num="3"/>The contest is here more equal <del>betwixt</del><ins comment="originally 'betwixt'; written change in Hume's hand">between</ins> the distemper and the medicine: And nothing can hinder the latter from proving effectual, but its being false and sophisticated.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="Su 2"><para><sc>It</sc> will here be superfluous to magnify the merits of philosophy, by displaying the pernicious tendency of that vice, of which it cures the human mind. The superstitious man, says <em>Tully</em><footnote num="1" sym="a"/>, is miserable in every scene, in every incident of life. Even sleep itself, which banishes all other cares of unhappy mortals, affords to him matter of new terror; while he examines his dreams, and finds in those visions of the night, prognostications of future calamities. I may add, that, tho’ death alone can put a full period to his misery, he dares not fly to this refuge, but still prolongs a misera<OPB ed="five dissertations" num="205"/>ble existence, from a vain fear, lest he offend <OPB num="4"/>his maker, by using the power, with which that beneficent being has endowed him. The presents of God and Nature are ravished from us by this cruel enemy; and notwithstanding that one step would remove us from the regions of pain and sorrow, her menaces still chain us down to a hated being, which she herself chiefly contributes to render miserable.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="Su 3"><para><del><sc>’Tis</sc></del><ins comment="originally '’Tis'; written change in Hume's hand"><sc>It is</sc></ins> observed of such as have been reduced by the calamities of life to the necessity of employing this fatal remedy, that, if the unseasonable care of their friends deprive them of <MPB ed="Mil" num="580"/>that species of death, which they proposed to themselves, they seldom venture upon any other, or can summon up so much resolution, a second time, as to execute their purpose. So great is our horror of death, that when it presents itself under any form, besides that to which a man has endeavoured to reconcile his imagination, it acquires new terrors, and <OPB num="5"/>overcomes his feeble courage. But when the menaces of superstition are joined to this natural timidity, no wonder it quite deprives men of all power over their lives; since even many pleasures and enjoyments, to which we are carried by a strong propensity, <OPB ed="five dissertations" num="206"/>are torn from us by this inhuman tyrant. Let us here endeavour to restore men to their native liberty, by examining all the common arguments against Suicide, and shewing, that <del>That</del><ins comment="originally 'That'; written change in Hume's hand">that</ins> action may be free from every imputation of guilt or blame; according to the sentiments of all the antient philosophers.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="Su 4"><para><sc>If</sc> Suicide be criminal, it must be a transgression of our duty, either to God, our neighbour, or ourselves.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="Su 5"><para><sc>To</sc> prove, that Suicide is no transgression of our duty to God, the following considerations may perhaps suffice. In order to govern the material world, the almighty creator has established general and immutable laws, <OPB num="6"/>by which all bodies, from the greatest planet to the smallest particle of matter, are maintained in their proper sphere and function. To govern the animal world, he has endowed all living creatures with bodily and mental powers; with senses, passions, appetites, memory, and judgment; by which they are impelled or regulated in that course of life, to which they are destined. These two distinct principles of the material and animal world continually encroach upon each other, and <OPB ed="five dissertations" num="207"/>mutually retard or forward each other’s operation. The powers of men and of all other animals are restrained and directed by the nature and qualities of the surrounding bodies; and the modifications and actions of these bodies are incessantly altered by the operation of all animals. Man is <del>stopt</del><ins comment="originally 'stopt' (or so I would guess, although the last letter is inked out completely and cannot be made out; written change in Hume's hand">stopped</ins> by rivers in his passage over the surface of the earth; and rivers, when properly directed, lend their force to the motion of machines, which serve to the use <OPB num="7"/><MPB ed="Mil" num="581"/>of man. But tho’ the provinces of the material and animal powers are not kept entirely separate, there result from thence no discord or disorder in the creation: On the contrary, from the mixture, union, and contrast of all the various powers of inanimate bodies and living creatures, arises that surprizing harmony and proportion, which affords the surest argument of supreme wisdom.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="Su 6"><para><sc>The</sc> providence of the deity appears not immediately in any operation, but governs every thing by those general and immutable laws, which have been established from the beginning of time. All events, in one sense, may be pronounced the action of the almighty: They all proceed from those powers, with which he has endowed his creatures. A house, which falls by its own <OPB ed="five dissertations" num="208"/>weight, is not brought to ruin by his providence more than one destroyed by the hands of men; nor are the human faculties less his workmanship than the laws of motion and gravitation. <OPB num="8"/>When the passions play, when the judgment dictates, when the limbs obey; this is all the operation of God; and upon these animate principles, as well as upon the inanimate, has he established the government of the universe.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="Su 7"><para><sc>Every</sc> event is alike important in the eyes of that infinite being, who takes in, at one glance, the most distant regions of space and remotest periods of time. There is no one event, however important to us, which he has exempted from the general laws that govern the universe, or which he has peculiarly reserved for his own immediate action and operation. The revolutions of states and empires depend upon the smallest caprice or passion of single men; and the lives of men are shortened or extended by the smallest accident of air or diet, sunshine or tempest. Nature still continues her progress and operation; and if general laws be ever broke by particular volitions of the deity, <del>’tis</del><ins comment="originally '’tis'; Hume changes this to 'it is' in several other places in these two essays, so he presumably missed this one by mistake">it is</ins> after a manner which entirely escapes hu<OPB num="9"/>man observation. As on the one hand, the elements and other in<OPB ed="five dissertations" num="209"/>animate parts of the creation carry on their action without regard to the particular interest and situation of men; so men are entrusted to their own judgment and discretion in the various shocks of matter, and may employ every faculty, <MPB ed="Mil" num="582"/>with which they are endowed, in order to provide for their ease, happiness, or preservation.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="Su 8"><para>What is the meaning, then, of that principle, that a man, who<ins comment="written insertion in Hume's hand">,</ins> tired of life, and hunted by pain and misery, bravely overcomes all the natural terrors of death, and makes his escape from this cruel scene; that such a man, I say, has incurred the indignation of his creator, by encroaching on the office of divine providence, and disturbing the order of the universe? Shall we assert, that the Almighty has reserved to himself, in any peculiar manner, the disposal of the lives of men, and has not submitted that event, in common with others, to the general laws, by which <OPB num="10"/>the universe is governed? This is plainly false. The lives of men depend upon the same laws as the lives of all other animals; and these are subjected to the general laws of matter and motion. The fall of a tower or the infusion of a poison will destroy a man equally with the meanest creature: An inundation sweeps away <OPB ed="five dissertations" num="210"/>every thing, without distinction, that comes within the <del>reach</del><ins comment="the first letter of this word is inked over (and thus illegible); it is unclear whether this is correcting the printed letter, but in any case it is obviously meant to be an 'r'">reach</ins> of its fury. Since therefore the lives of men are for ever dependent on the general laws of matter and motion; is a man’s disposing of his life criminal, because, in every case, it is criminal to encroach upon these laws, or disturb their operation? But this seems absurd. All animals are entrusted to their own prudence and skill for their conduct in the world, and have full authority, as far as their power extends, to alter all the operations of nature. Without the exercise of this authority, they could not subsist a moment. Every action, every motion of a man in<OPB num="11"/>novates in the order of some parts of matter, and diverts<ins comment="written insertion in Hume's hand">,</ins> from their ordinary course, the general laws of motion. Putting together, therefore, these conclusions, we find, <em>that</em> human life depends upon the general laws of matter and motion, and <em>that</em> <del>’tis</del><ins comment="originally '’tis'; Hume changes this to 'it is' in several other places in these two essays, so he presumably missed this one by mistake">it is</ins> no encroachment on the office of providence to disturb or alter these general laws. Has not every one, of consequence, the free disposal of his own life? And may he not lawfully employ that power with which nature has endowed him?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="Su 9"><para><sc>In</sc> order to destroy the evidence of this conclusion, we must shew a reason, why this par<OPB ed="five dissertations" num="211"/>ticular case is excepted. Is it because human life is of so great importance, that <del>’tis</del><ins comment="originally '’tis'; written change in Hume's hand">it is</ins> a <MPB ed="Mil" num="583"/>presumption for human prudence to dispose of it? But the life of man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster. And were it of ever so great importance, the order of nature has actually submitted it to human prudence, and reduced us to a necessity, in every incident, of determining <OPB num="12"/>concerning it.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="Su 10"><para><sc>Were</sc> the disposal of human life so much reserved as the peculiar province of the almighty that it were an encroachment on his right for men to dispose of their own lives; it would be equally criminal to act for the preservation of life as for its destruction. If I turn aside a stone, which is falling upon my head, I disturb the course of nature, and I invade the peculiar province of the almighty, by lengthening out my life, beyond the period, which, by the general laws of matter and motion, he had assigned <ins comment="written insertion in Hume's hand">to</ins> it.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="Su 11"><para><sc>A hair</sc>, a fly, an insect is able to destroy this mighty being, whose life is of such importance. Is it an absurdity to suppose, that human prudence may lawfully dispose of what depends on such insignificant causes?</para></dhot>

<dhot id="Su 13"><para><sc>Do</sc> you imagine that I repine at providence or curse my creation, because I go out of life, and put a period to a being, which, were it to continue, would render me miserable? Far be such sentiments from me. I am only convinced of a matter of fact, which you yourself acknowledge possible, that human life may be unhappy, and that my existence, if farther prolonged, would become uneligible. But I thank providence, both for the good, which I have already enjoyed, and for the power, with which I am endowed, of escaping the ill that threatens me<footnote num="2" sym="a"/>. To you it belongs to repine at providence, who foolishly imagine that you have no such power, and who must <MPB ed="Mil" num="584"/>still prolong a hated <del>life</del><ins comment="originally 'life'; written change in Hume's hand">being</ins>, tho’ loaded with pain and sickness, with shame and poverty.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="Su 15"><para><sc>The</sc> submission, which you require to providence, in every calamity, that befalls me, excludes not human skill and industry; if possibly, by their means, I can avoid or escape the calamity. And why may I not employ one remedy as well as another?</para></dhot>
<dhot id="Su 16"><para><sc>If</sc> my life be not my own, it were criminal for me to put it in danger, as well as to dispose of it: Nor could one man deserve the appellation of <em>Hero</em>, whom glory or friendship transports into the greatest dangers, and another merit the reproach of <em>Wretch</em> or <em>Miscreant</em>, who puts a period to his life, from the same or like motives.</para></dhot>

Be it animate or inanimate, rational or irrational, <del>’tis</del><ins comment="originally '’tis'; Hume changes this to 'it is' in several other places in these two essays, so he presumably missed this one by mistake">it is</ins> all a case: <del>It’s</del><ins comment="originally 'It’s'">Its</ins> power is still derived from the supreme creator, and is alike comprehended in the order of his providence.

<dhot id="Su 21"><para><del><sc>’Tis</sc></del><ins comment="originally '’Tis'; written change in Hume's hand"><sc>It is</sc></ins> a kind of blasphemy to imagine, that any created being can disturb the order of the world, or invade the business of providence. It supposes, that that being possesses powers and faculties, which it received not from its creator, and which are not subordinate to his government and authority. A man may disturb society, no doubt; and thereby incur the displeasure of the almighty: But the government of <OPB ed="five dissertations" num="217"/>the world is placed far beyond his reach and violence. And how does it appear, that the almighty is displeased with those actions, that disturb society? By the principles which he has implanted in human nature, and which inspire us with a sentiment of remorse, if we ourselves have been guilty of such actions, <OPB num="19"/>and with that of blame and disapprobation, if we ever observe them in others. Let us now examine, according to the method proposed, whether Suicide be of this kind of actions, and be a breach of our duty to our <em>neighbour</em> and to society.</para></dhot>
<dhot id="Su 22"><para><sc>A man</sc>, who retires from life, does no harm to society. He only ceases to do good; which, if it be an injury, is of the lowest kind.</para></dhot>

<dhot id="Su 24"><para><sc>But</sc> allowing, that our obligations to do good were perpetual, they have certainly some bounds. I am not obliged to do a small good <OPB ed="five dissertations" num="218"/>to society, at the expence of a great harm to myself. Why then should I prolong a miserable existence, because of some frivolous advantage, which the public may, perhaps, receive <OPB num="20"/>from me? If upon account of age and infirmities, I may lawfully resign any office, and employ my time altogether in fencing against these calamities, and alleviating, as much as possible, the miseries of my future life: Why may I not cut short these miseries at once by an action, which is no more prejudicial to society?</para></dhot>

<dhot id="Su n4"><note sym="a">It would be easy to prove, that Suicide is as lawful under the <em>christian</em> dispensation as it was to the heathens. There is not a single text of scripture, which prohibits it. That great and infallible rule of faith and practice, which must controul all philosophy and human reasoning, has left us, in this particular, to our natural liberty. Resignation to providence is, indeed, recommended in scripture; but that implies only submission to ills, which are unavoidable, not to such as may be remedied by prudence or courage. <em>Thou shalt not kill</em> is evidently meant to exclude only the killing of others, over whose life we have no <OPB ed="five dissertations" num="221"/>authority. That this precept like most of the scripture precepts, must be modified by reason and common sense, is plain from the practice of magistrates, who punish criminals capitally, notwithstanding the letter of this law. But were this commandment ever so express against Suicide, it could now have no authority. For all the law of <em>Moses</em> is abolished, except so far as it is established by the law of nature; and we have already endeavoured to prove, that Suicide is not prohibited <MPB ed="Mil" num="589"/>by that law. In all cases, <em>Christians</em> and <em>Heathens</em> are precisely upon the same footing; and if <em>Cato</em> and <em>Brutus</em>, <em>Arria</em> and <em>Portia</em> acted heroically, those who now imitate their example ought to receive the same praises from posterity.
