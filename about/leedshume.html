<h2>The Leeds Hume Project (archived page, July 2001)</h2>
<p>This is a new web project co-ordinated by Peter Millican, Director of the Leeds Electronic Text Centre and a keen Hume scholar. Starting in May 2000, the aim of the project is to provide a <em>permanent</em> resource for scholars and students wishing to have access, <em>free of charge</em>, to <em>high quality texts</em> of works by, and associated with, the great philosopher and historian David Hume, together with <em>relevant bibliographic materials</em>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A Permanent Resource</strong><br>The texts published here are intended to be in a finished state (with any future revisions being fully documented), and to remain available from the site on a permanent basis. Hence - in contrast to most other Web resources - they may safely be referenced in academic works with confidence that future readers will remain able to consult them.</li>
  <li><strong>Free of Charge</strong><br>Access to the texts and bibliographic materials published here is free of charge, but provided on the strict condition that they are neither altered nor sold unless written permission is given by the copyright holder. Anyone making copies from this site should respect carefully the copyright restrictions applying to the relevant materials - typically they will be freely copiable for personal scholarly and class use only, and any copy (whether electronic or in printed form) must incorporate a notice recording the restrictions that apply.</li>
  <li><strong>Reliable Texts</strong><br>Historical texts will be placed on this site only if they have been thoroughly checked against original sources, the aim being to provide 100% accuracy in the text, including spelling, punctuation, capitalisation etc. The 1777 text of the <i>Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</i> presented here is, as far as can be ascertained, the only major Hume text available on the Web which even approaches this standard of accuracy.</li>
  <li><strong>Bibliographic Materials</strong><br>It is intended that each Hume text published here be accompanied (either immediately, or in due course) by a <i>survey of the relevant secondary literature</i>, to enable those researching, teaching, or studying the text to get to grips with current debates quickly and easily. This type of resource is particularly suitable for delivery via the Web, because the secondary literature on Hume is growing so quickly. The bibliographic surveys on the site will be updated regularly, and interested scholars or students are advised to 'bookmark' them for future reference.</li>
  <li><strong>Works by, and associated with, David Hume</strong><br>This project will publish not only works by Hume himself, but also works associated with him, from contemporary sources to essays by modern scholars. Hume scholars are invited to offer their work for publication here, but such work will be accepted only with the written agreement of the copyright holder, and only if the author guarantees that the work is in a reliable and permanent form.</li>
</ul>
