<h2>Update, March 2018</h2>
<p><em>by Amyas Merivale</em></p>
<p>When the Leeds Electronic Text Centre closed in 2011, I continued working on my doctorate full time, and then returned to Oxford to work as a lecturer and outreach officer. Work and family commitments inevitably took over, and for almost seven years this site remained unchanged. During that time I learned a lot more about building web sites, however, and I am delighted to have finally found the tie to give this site a much-needed overhaul. In fact, “overhaul” is an understatement: the site has been more or less completely rebuilt from scratch. Search functionality has been redesigned, and now incorporates a <em>simple search</em>, for finding a passage whose location you cannot remember, alongside an <em>advanced search</em>, for interrogating Hume’s texts for his uses of various terms. I very much hope the recent changes will be welcomed by our many users; please feel free to contact me if you have any suggestsions.</p>
