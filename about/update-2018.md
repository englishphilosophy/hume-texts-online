## Update, March 2018

_by Amyas Merivale_

When the Leeds Electronic Text Centre closed in 2011, I continued working on my doctorate full time, and then returned to Oxford to work as a lecturer and outreach officer. Work and family commitments inevitably took over, and for almost six years this site remained unchanged. During that time I learned a lot more about building web sites, however, and I am delighted to have finally found the time to give this site a much-needed overhaul.

- With an entirely new look, the site now works better on small screens and mobile devices.
- The site structure has been simplified, dividing everything into three main areas: [Texts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link index.html %}) (for Humeâ€™s texts and associated editorial commentary), [Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link notes/index.md %}) (for help on how to use the site and information on our general editorial policies) and [Scholarship]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link scholarship/index.md %}) (for bibliographies, papers, and links to other resources).
- Editorial notes can now be found immediately alongside each text, by clicking on the notes icon <span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-edit"></i></span> next to the search bar.
- Search functionality has been completely redesigned. The search bar now appears at the top of every text, and searches are restricted to the text (or set of texts) on that page. The default _simple search_ is for finding specific passages, and it will endeavour to match variant spellings, so as to maximise your chances of finding the passage you want. By switching to _advanced search_, meanwhile, you can interrogate our database of texts for scholarly purposes, using _regular expressions_. See the [Help]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link notes/help.md %}) page for more information.
- The site is now open source. You can view the code that generates these pages, including the database of texts, at [https://github.com/merivale/davidhume.org](https://github.com/merivale/davidhume.org).
