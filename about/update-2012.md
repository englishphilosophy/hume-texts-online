## Update, May 2012

A year after the previous version of this site was launched, we are proud to unveil the latest version of davidhume.org. We have been hard at work over the last twelve months, making the following major improvements:

- We have added the texts of *A Letter from a Gentleman* and the remaining *Essays*, thus completing our collection. We now have texts of everything that Hume published apart from the historical writings. This is the first electronic edition of Hume's collected philosophical works to be made publicly available completely free of charge.
- All of our texts are now fully searchable. Using our substantial database of around 5,000 paragraphs of text, you can perform conjunctive and disjunctive searches, search for phrases, restrict your search to particular texts, lookup pages by paragraph number, or paragraphs by page number. Again, this is the first searchable edition of Hume's philosophical texts to be made available completely free of charge. We very much hope that you find this feature useful. And feel free to tell us if you do, as it was a huge job getting it set up!
- A number of formatting details have been improved; it would be tedious to list them all, but suffice it to say that the look of our editions here is now about as close to the 18th century originals as it is possible to get, without neglecting the advantages of modern editions.
